# LDAC Bibliography

Linked Data in Architecture and Construction (LDAC) is the premier conference on Semantic BIM.
It's actually a workshop and a summer school, and manages to attract an excellent and very supportive community.
If you haven't attended yet, I highly recommend it!

[LDAC.bib](LDAC.bib) has full bibliographies of LDAC 2018-2025; 2017 and earlier years have group reports not individual papers.

The [Semantic BIM](https://www.zotero.org/groups/3007408/semantic_bim/library) Zotero library also has full bibliographies,
see the [0 Proceedings](https://www.zotero.org/groups/3007408/semantic_bim/collections/XGS5UCIF) collection.
- Recent LDAC workshops (but not 2025) have been published at CEUR-WS.
  This makes it easy to obtain a bibliography, since Zotero now has an improved CEUR-WS plugin (parser).
  For the rest, I've made `.bib` files using the Emacs editor, or perl scripts (e.g. [ldac2025.pl](ldac2025.pl))
- LDAC is often collocated with the CIM W78, EG-ICE and/or EC3 conferences.
  This makes it a bit harder to extract paper links.
  [LDAC2021-get.sh](LDAC2021-get.sh) is a script to download all LDAC 2021 papers and presentations from the LDAC 2021 and W80 2021 sites.

We are looking for your help to dispatch these excellent contributions into the Zotero topical hierarchy! 
- Please join the [Semantic BIM](https://www.zotero.org/groups/3007408/semantic_bim/) group (as of Nov 2025, it has 47 members)
- Then "copy" items from `0 Proceedings` into the topical sub-collections, add tags, and Abstracts
- Feel free to create new topical branches as needed
