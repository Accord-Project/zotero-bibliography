    important for sustainable design and management of our built environment. Conducting LCA on buildings requires access to highly contextualized
    information which can be sourced from the Building Information Model (BIM) or monitoring systems in place. The interoperability between LCA domain
    tools and BIM tools is lacking. Our motivation lies in semantically bridging LCA and built environment domains by adopting a Semantic Web (SW)
    technologies. This would result in increased interoperability on the web, increased automation of information pipelines and more explainable
    impacts of complex contexts. In this paper we introduce the work in progress under the SemanticLCA ontology where we modelled several use cases
    for LCA of built assets. To demonstrate this, we showcase one case study at the building level, highlighting the semantic alignments between BIM
    models, LCA data and sensing devices. The paper discusses the implementation challenges and offers suggestions on how such an ontology can be used

    transportation industry has recently adopted IFC as the standard data schema for the exchange of electronic engineering data. This is significant
    because the transportation agencies are progressing toward BIM as the successor to the standard plan set for highway infrastructure.
    Unfortunately, as previous studies indicate, IFC is currently limited in modeling the full capacity of bridges and infrastructure data exchange.
    Utilizing IFC P-Sets and ontology models have been the current workaround to enable the full information exchange. The challenge with properly
    modeling such ontologies is that the breadth of knowledge needing to be captured, from all the stakeholder perspectives and all bridge and
    infrastructure elements, is a large undertaking without the direct support from the industry. Additionally, each state agency has their own
    processes, terminology, and culture that further complicate the challenge. To mitigate these challenges, research has been ongoing to create a
    national data dictionary to support current US national efforts and promote alignment across the various state agencies. This paper presents an
    overview of the research and the methodology in creating a bridge and infrastructure data dictionary. Current limitations and open challenges are
    presented. As this work is still ongoing, the goal is to continue the development of the data dictionary in a collaborative effort to ensure that

    is automatically generated from the ETS5 project file describing the KNX network in our building using the W3C TD ontology, and points to
    real-time and historical data. Our approach offers an alternative with respect to the state of the art such that: (1) relevant bits of the
    building’s KG can be accessed using a simple REST-like interface, where each small KG contains links to other entities that themselves are
    identified by an IRI and have a small KG accessible; (2) Knowledge potentially served by different servers can be integrated in the same solution;
    (3) simple access control can be implemented for some parts of the global KG.},

    However, major information redundancy can be found in the smart building data. This paper proposed a partial correlation graph based approach to
    map the dependencies among sensors and detect the sensor communities in which the sensors are strongly “net” correlated. Specifically, the sparse
    partial correlation estimation method is used to learn the partial correlation graph. The Louvain algorithm is used to detect the communities of
    sensors by optimising the graph modularity. The case study demonstrates that the proposed method can identify spare sensors in the detected sensor
    communities and thus enhance the computational feasibility of smart building applications.},

    dramatically. Along with the advances in the AEC domain, a massive amount of data is collected from sensors, project management software, drones
    and 3D scanning. However, the construction regulatory knowledge has maintained primarily in the form of unstructured text. Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) has been recently introduced to the construction industry to extract underlying knowledge from unstructured data. For instance,
    NLP can be used to extract key information from construction contracts and specifications, identify potential risks, and automate compliance
    checking. It is considered impractical for construction engineers and stakeholders to author formal, accurate, and structured building regulatory
    rules. However, previous efforts on extracting knowledge from unstructured text in AEC domain have mainly focused on basic concepts and
    hierarchies for ontology engineering using traditional NLP techniques, rather than deeply digging in the nature of the used NLP techniques and
    their abilities to capture semantics from the building regulations text. In this context, this paper focuses on the development of a
    semantic-based testing approach that studies the performance of modern NLP techniques, namely word embeddings and transformers, on extracting
    semantic regularities within the building regulatory text. Specifically, this paper studies the ability of word2vec, BERT, and Sentence BERT
    (SBERT) to extract semantic regularities from the British building regulations at both word and sentence levels. The UK building regulations code
    has been used as a dataset. The ground truth of semantic regulations has been manually curated from the well-established Brick Ontology to test
    the performance of the proposed NLP techniques to capture the semantic regularities from the building regulatory text. Both quantitative and
    qualitative analyses have been performed, and the obtained results show that modern NLP techniques can reliably capture semantic regularities from
    the building regulations text at both word and sentence levels, with an accuracy that reaches 80\% at the word-level, and hits 100\% at the
    sentence-level.},

Two RDF-star approaches and a state construction inspired by the Ontology for Property Management (OPM) are introduced. Moreover, we show Event System method that is close to the original BCF API. To compare the approaches, queries to get the current data and search the history are provided on an external repository. Finally, the results and their adaptation for LBD, in general, are assessed.}

Domain-specific collaboration platforms, the so-called Common Data Environments (CDEs), facilitate complex interactions between the various offices participating in a project. CDEs are developed and maintained by the large BIM companies allowing deep integration with BIM authoring tools. Notwithstanding the benefits such integration offers, usage of proprietary tools, data models and platforms holds the risk of a vendor lock-in and creates dependencies on platform APIs as the sole funnels trough which project data can be accessed - even when using open data formats. Recently, technologies for re-decentralising the Web are causing furore, as they allow decoupling data storage from applications. The Solid initiative bundles these technologies in a domain-independent way. In previous work we have already discussed data patterns for the AEC industry, using these technologies - the LBDserver. In this paper, we demonstrate how these very generic data organisation patterns can be aligned with common industry standards - facilitating compatibility with existing, centralised approaches while maintaining the benefits of organising digital projects in a federated way.}

However, research shows that HVAC systems only ensure occupants satisfaction in the 11% of the commercial buildings. The advancing spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the maturity of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) may contribute to develop accurate predictive models which address this challenge. But data analysts in charge of developing these predictive models may feel overwhelmed if they have insufficient domain expertise. In this article, the ontology-driven approach proposed by the EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) is presented, in which data analysts can benefit from previously captured domain knowledge to get support regarding which are the variables to consider when developing a model which accurately predicts the thermal comfort within buildings. Compared with the existing tools or methods, the EEPSA is able to suggest variables that may not necessarily be included in the set of data available. This fact has a big potential nowadays, where the Linked Open Data and the third-party repositories are valuable sources of knowledge which can be exploited to incorporate relevant information to the set of data available.}

Semantic web technologies promise to reduce data interoperability issues. However, methods to discover occupants’ experiences and integrate those with linked building data are scarce. This paper aims to show how combining knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technology could lead to an improved understanding of occupants’ experiences in buildings. This approach is applied to a case study using the Open Family Home. An occupant collected feedback on various comfort indicators using a smartwatch app. Building information, sensor data, weather data, and occupant information and feedback were integrated into a cross-domain semantic digital twin. A Python script collected all the data from the digital twin and ran a data analysis, after which parameters that affected the occupant’s experience were collected. The results were transformed into triples and integrated with the linked building data. This combination of knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technologies results in enriched digital twins that can be used for occupant-centric decision-making. The approach presented in this study was generalized into a four-step method that can be applied at a variety of use-cases in the architecture, engineering, and construction domain.}

As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by modular disciplinary ontolo-gies, can provide a solid ground to share and exchange data flexibly.}

Interoperability problems between different software often hinder disciplinary data integration, which prevents the recognition of violated design constraints until it is too late. The open-source platform Building Habitat object Model (BHoM) integrates many AEC concepts across existing languages and platforms, allowing multiple discrete disciplinary representations of buildings. The Linked Building Data Community Group of the World Wide Web Consortium uses Semantic Web standards to store and share data. This paper explores and presents methods to recast BHoM's object model as a knowledge graph using Semantic Web standards. It analyzes BHoM in an ontological context by elaborating on its approach to object-oriented programming and comparing it to the Semantic Web standards. Furthermore, it presents BHoM RDF prototypes as a potential solution to the interoperability problem of multidisciplinary design in AEC. It also exemplifies these BHoM RDF prototypes on a small demonstrator project. When combined with Semantic Web standards, the BHoM framework can increase the use of knowledge graphs in the AEC industry, improving data interoperability and assisting design decisions through reasoning.}

It is difficult to develop and maintain an ontological representation for such forms of data. This research work explored the use of concept networks as means to link BIM to unstructured data. Using topic modeling tools, a set of key terms are extracted from documents. The relationships between these key terms are investigated. A network of these key terms is established.

In this presentation, we would like to share our experiences using ontologies and DT for building comfort & energy optimization. Firstly, a brief introduction to the Ontology Central will be made, which is an open-source Digital Twin Description Language (DTDL) ontology library for commercial buildings. Currently, three ontology models, namely the Foundation, Fire Alarm Systems, and HVAC Systems are provided and can be reused across buildings, systems, and services. Among them, the Foundation Ontology offers the digital common foundation layer for domain-specific ontologies and is motivated by several RDF ontology models e.g. Building Topology Ontology (BOT) and Brick. A pipeline that supports the conversion between the DTDL and RDF format is under development. Currently, a mapping between the Foundation ontology and the BOT ontology in perspective of space and asset is supported and will be presented. Afterwards, a smart analytic software service for building and its HVAC system called “HVAC Performance Analyzer” will be introduced, which deploys the Bosch ontologies and provides overall information about the building comfort as well as the system operation, based on the assessment of measured data. Several buildings of Bosch and its customers are on-boarded, monitored, and continuously managed by this service. Lastly, the successful deployment of the proposed ontology models as digital twin instances on the Microsoft Azure Digital Twin platform and corresponding analysis will be demonstrated. Smart building algorithms, called as Domain Expert Insight Models (DEIMs) for fault detection and predictive maintenance are developed. A proof-of-concept (PoC) study deploying the DEIM algorithm for energy optimization will be shown. Thanks to the DT and ontology models, the smart algorithms can be applied to other existing buildings without any modifications. The PoC study proves that DT plays a vital role in enabling scalable solutions to energy system optimization in the near future. One ongoing research of Bosch will be to onboard existing buildings with open-source RDF ontology and to enable further data analytics using semantic web technology. In summary, this presentation provides an overview of the development of ontology and DT applications of Bosch Building Technologies, which is believed to be invaluable to the facility management community.}

It relates to an ongoing implementation and related prototype being developed by an automation systems provider. Modern buildings have complex technical equipment which is hard to operate efficiently from a user’s point of view. Optimal commissioning and operation of building energy systems necessitate complex design and configuration of building automation and control systems (BACS). Generally, a BACS supplier or installer uses its own software system and customized monitoring databases. The presented approach tries to automate BACS setup relying on semantic modeling and knowledge reuse. It shall support the design and configuration of complex BACS systems by the means of automated characterization of the underlying building energy system and inferring of its most adapted control systems and strategies. For that purpose, it makes use of ontologies for modeling the topology of energy systems as well as emulating the knowledge of BACS design experts.
Indeed, automation providers have much expert knowledge and experience in the design, evaluation and commissioning of energy system controls. It is investigated whether this manufacturer expertise can be represented via knowledge representation and model parameterization. A workflow is proposed that shall make it possible to support automated BACS design relying on a formalized description of HVAC systems from a wide variety of application fields using a generic templates library. For this purpose, existing energy systems are examined with regard to various structural properties such as topology, energy flows and control loop structures as well as needed sensors and monitoring functions. It is taken into account that the energy supply of buildings is planned individually to a high level of detail due to different system requirements. Therefore, an automated design of control systems requires the limitation and classification of possible system configurations.
Knowledge about control concepts and controller architectures of distributed energy systems is required for the automatic generation of control architectures. This knowledge must be collected, systematized and stored appropriately. At the beginning, relevant controller concepts and controller architectures for the application in the targeted energy system are selected and described. A component library contains models for controllers and energy system components as well as buildings and plant models. For this purpose, it is necessary to create tools that allow the semi-automatic generation and testing of such components from the library. A prototype is being implemented inside design software of IFM automation solutions provider in cooperation with Fraunhofer.}

Also, reducing commissioning lead-time allows fast operation and more significant financial results. However, the on-site procedures of inspection and tests are mostly still managed by conventional ways paper-work-based, although some applications based on information technologies (e.g., tablets and PDF files) have already started to bring digital solutions to the field, that is not enough. Lacking interoperability is a persistent issue that inhibits process-oriented management. From this, CERTI Foundation, a Centres of Reference in Innovative Technologies, and an O&G Company from Brazil deployed a research and technological development project to implement a solution that allows middle-users to model and deploy on-site commissioning process-task-based. Also, workers and inspectors can receive and record on mobile devices the activities information. An Information Delivery Manual (IDM), ISO/DIS 29481-1 (2014), is performed to capture the current business process integrating all stakeholders (e.g., O&G company, system providers, and new system developers). The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) ISO 16739:2018 is adopted as a neutral language and open data format to collaborate data between the new system developed for the owner O&G company and their suppliers to achieve high agility supply chains. An ifcJSON-4 version in sync with IFC EXPRESS Schema was developed to extend IFC to O&G Commissioning management information. It is totally queryable (CRUD operations) via REST API, allowing clients to access the exact information of interest. We have then translated the IFC data model into RDF, and we are currently working on semantic enrichment of the data in order to achieve new levels of queryable data and intelligent automatic inferences. This work presents the latest data schemas developed for the O&G sector and the proof of concepts conducted. Finally, the discussions lead to some conclusions as the commissioning processes need to be faster while maintaining security for workers, and the first step is standardising its information. Nothing is better than using neutral and universal formats, and IFC fits to achieve this. The second step is making the information available to end-users, and REST APIs to query IFC data do the work. The third step is to enrich the data model semantically, and again IFC might provide a shortcut to that by ifcOWL. We need then to continue the enrichment process by diving deeper into semantics and linked data in order to enable automatic inferences capability. The project's future directions are concerning the creation of a semantic web data model, which will be the basis for using AI in conjunction with a high-capacity data bus, to automatically detect bottlenecks in the commissioning process.}

  abstract     = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has brought great benefits to the construction industry by gathering all information in a
    project and making it available to the involved stakeholders. However, BIM has predominantly generated value in the design phase of a project,
    while the potential benefits in the construction phase have been disregarded for many years and are now gaining importance. Trending advancements
    try to utilize existing BIM data, e.g by linking a digital building model with planning efforts of the construction project and create new
    knowledge to improve construction. In this paper, we are interested in exploring how semantic models and Linked Building Data (LBD) can support
    value creation in the construction phase. The presented use case tries to answer the question how the planning of Temporary Construction Items
    (TCIs) can be improved by semantically describing and classifying TCIs in an ontology that allows to utilize TCI information with BIM data. TCIs
    only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus,
    the creation of an ontology in this field shall lead to a better and more automated consideration of TCIs in construction planning. Here, we
    follow the recommendation of the W3C - LBD community group to extend or develop new ontologies and propose the TCI ontology as the main
    contribution. We first introduce the TCI ontology and its relation to other ontologies. Then we demonstrate the value of the ontology by answering
    competency questions and finally provide a proof of concept of planning TCIs by utilizing the new ontology. The proposal of the TCI ontology is
    accompanied by a second ontology for Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) to consider the time dimension of planning. The main focus, however, lies on
    the development and presentation of the TCI ontology whereas the LBS ontology will be further developed in future research.},

  abstract     = {The BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) is a buildingSMART standard used to exchange issues in a digital model between heterogeneous
    software applications and planners. Although the BCF issues are spatially located in a model and provide links to building elements, the format is
    only loosely connected to the actual BIM model. While the format is well suited for its original use case, it lacks the flexibility to retrieve
    information from the BCF in conjunction with the BIM model. In this paper, we introduce the BIM Collaboration Format Ontology (bcfOWL), which
    translates the format to the Semantic Web and harnesses the expressive richness of OWL. We present the structure of the ontology and highlight the
    differences with existing implementations of BCF. Using example queries, we show how extended relationships between a BIM model and BCF
    information are enabled by bcfOWL. We show that by transferring BCF to Linked Data, the format's applicability is enhanced without losing
    compatibility with existing implementations and workflows. In doing so, the ontology aims to integrate into the Linked Building Data environment
    and facilitates access to synergies between heterogeneous building data.},

    practices can be described as static as they are based on file exchange, mainly using IFC files. Instead, in an ideal level 3 BIM platform,
    different stakeholders could work together on a single centralized building model, using different domain-specific vocabularies, and updating the
    model synchronously. We propose an approach based on semantic rule reasoning to dynamically convert information in different vocabularies. While
    existing alignments only cover class conversions, we develop inference rules that handle conversion of relations in a dynamic and transparent way,
    being executed by a reasoner. The approach is implemented and tested on converting models from ifcOWL to BIM4Ren, a BOT-based ontology. The
    scalability of the implementation is discussed as well as its limitation.},

    (ASB-ING) into a semantic ontology. Thus, an extensive data model is created that enables the representation of infrastructure and
    maintenance-related facts in Linked Data and is compatible with the German standards and guidelines. The national standard "ASB-ING" contains
    about 120 classes and 500 attributes to describe a bridge or tunnel and its damages. It is the basis for the relational database program
    "SIB-Bauwerke", in which most bridges in Germany are recorded over the last 20 years. By converting the ASB-ING model into an Ontology,
    compatibility with this extensive available data set is ensured, enabling a direct translation of the existing asset data into Linked Data models.
    Concurrently, it is possible to relate the classes of this national data model with classes of other national or international ontologies. By
    mapping the ASB-ING Ontology to ifcOWL, the formerly only tabular data can be linked to standardised geometry models without requiring
    additionally developed geometric representation. Interlinking the ASB-ING Ontology with other international and national infrastructure data
    models can improve asset information exchange of cross-border projects.},

  abstract     = {This presentation describes the use of linked data approaches to permit queries across large, diverse information sources to allow
    reasoning about complex questions at multiple geographic scales. The developed methodology leverages a central spine model that provides a common
    hierarchical context; various heterogeneous external information sources can be associated with these contexts, creating a homogeneous data
    network that can be queried using federated SPARQL queries. These distributed sources are, in themselves, registered in a central catalogue in
    order to facilitate data discovery; the actual data, however, remains under the control of their source organisations. In this way a large,
    extensible, interconnected network of distributed data describing a built environment can be constructed; this network can be queried centrally to
    provide customised views of subsets of the data.. The utility of the architecture is demonstrated by establishing a data network to support
    Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) analysts to investigate the impact of various decarbonisation scenarios on the Irish
    transmission grid. An instance of the Dynamic District Information Model (DDIM) server was used for this analysis. Large datasets were necessary
    to support this investigation, including details of 220 transmission nodes, c.16,500 small areas and approximately 2 million residential
    buildings. A series of residential energy archetypes were developed, including as-is and energy consumption per residence archetype for numerous
    scenarios, including the adoption of heat pumps and electric vehicles. It was found that the DDIM approach enabled integration of large scale and
    heterogeneous datasets, finer grained data analysis, and improved the accuracy of the analysis.},

    (GIS) enables syner-getic effects between these domains. A common approach to define links between cor-responding objects are identity relation
    like owl:sameAs from the Web Ontology Lan-guage (OWL). Identity relations suggests that everything stated about one entity hold for the
    corresponding entity (i.e., they share all of their properties). However, this kind of semantics is too strict for linking objects from
    heterogeneous information models. This paper shows the issue of the strict semantics of identity relations for linking build-ing elements of
    heterogeneous information models like Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML. In more detail, related literature about heterogeneities and
    links between IFC and CityGML are reviewed. Afterwards, the issue caused by the strict semantics of identity links for linking IFC and CityGML
    models is illustrated and al-ternative approaches to identity links are discussed. As a result, identity links are prone to be misleading for
    linking building elements represented in Industry Foundation Clas-ses (IFC) and CityGML models. However, alternative linking approaches have the
    short coming that they generally rely on the correct interpretation of the user.},

  abstract     = {In AECO industry (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation), BIM methodology is consolidated as the most efficient way
    to design, build, operate, maintain and demolish infrastructures by i) achieving the digital representation of the infrastructure including
    geometric and non-geometric information, ii) allowing for a more efficient collaborative work among the different stakeholders and disciplines,
    and iii) covering all the phases in the infrastructure life cycle (from the planning and design up to the demolition). However, some disciplines
    are not properly integrated within the workflows of BIM methodology. Therefore, the related information is not properly integrated in the As-Built
    BIM model of the infrastructure and it is not shared among stakeholders following BIM standards. This is the case of the Geotechnical
    Investigation and Quality Control activities accomplish during the planning, design and construction processes of the infrastructure life cycle.
    This is the challenged tackled by the R&I project ICONYC developed by the Engineering Company CEMOSA, funded by the Spanish Government, and
    presented here. Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control are core activities for CEMOSA. In the ICONYC project, CEMOSA has developed a
    methodology to integrate such processes within the BIM workflow allowing for the digital transformation of these activities. This presentation
    will describe the i) Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control processes workflows; ii) the mobile apps for field data gathering
    (geotechnical drilling, surveys, inspections and samples) developed in SAP Fiori; iii) the apps for the information analysis (tests, incidences,
    communications, geotechnical layers, etc) developed on SAP ERP; iv) the apps for the generation of the Geotechnical Investigation and Quality
    Control BIM models developed by means of APIs from XBIM and Revit and, v) the Common Data Environment (CDE) which allows the sharing of site
    information (including documents, BIM models, CAD drawings, inspection, surveys, samples, incidences…) and management information (tasks,
    milestones, communications, stakeholders…) among all the participants. The CDE has been developed based on SAP Fiori, Autodesk BIM360 and Autodesk
    Forge. In addition, it will be described the Data Model to store on SAP ERP the information related to the Quality Control (batch, inspections,
    surveys, check points, samples, tests, incidences, communications, etc.) and the Geotechnical Investigations (drillings, samples, tests,
    geotechnical layers, etc) as well as the mapping of said Data Model with the IFC classes schema and the definition of the property sets to store
    the relevant quality control and geotechnical information. The integration of Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control processes into the
    BIM methodology produce a more accurate As-Build BIM Model, including the actual characteristics of the infrastructure executed and allowing for a
    better traceability of the control processes carried out and, consequently, a greater guarantee on the debugging of responsibilities in possible
    future infrastructure ‘s pathologies as well as a reduction in the possible mistakes in the integration of geotechnical parameters and, therefore,
    achieving a more optimised foundation designs. All of this reverts in a better collaboration among all stakeholders in a more cost-effective way.},

    software tools from BIM and GIS domains. However, no single open data standard available today can support all information from the two do-mains.
    As a result, many researchers have been working to overlap or connect different open data standards to enhance interoperability. An overview of
    these studies will help identify the different approaches used and determine the ap-proach with the most potential to enhance interoperability.
    This paper adopted a strong definition of interoperability using information technology (IT) based standard documents. Based on this definition,
    previous approaches towards im-proving interoperability between BIM and GIS applications through open data standards were studied. The result
    shows previous approaches have implemented data conversion, data integration, and linked data approaches. Between these methods, linked data
    emerged as having the most potential to connect open data standards and expand interoperability between BIM and GIS applications be-cause it
    allows information exchange without editing the original data. The paper also identifies the main challenges in implementing linked data

  abstract     = {"Ontology-based Building Energy System Commissioning and Monitoring": Commissioning and operating building energy systems
    necessitates much configuration and testing work of the building monitoring and automation system. Generally suppliers and installers use singular
    proprietary software systems and customized monitoring databases. Once setup and in operation, there is also no guarantee that the building is
    energy-efficient and most of time building users themselves act as energy wasting factors due to their wrong usage of the building energy system.
    As a response, the presented work aims at developing an expert system that shall ease the transition between design and operation as well as
    provide live recommendations for a continuous commissioning of the building energy system. For that purpose, it relies on Building Information
    Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web technologies. The presented approach tries then to bring a complementary added value to classical building
    automation and control systems (BACS) by the means of semantic modeling and knowledge reuse for semantic analysis and characterization of the
    building energy system and its operational conditions. For that purpose, it implements a knowledge base of energy conservation measures and
    potential operating errors that prescribe energy-efficiency actions and handlings to building users or a facility managers. The system consumes
    for a part building data gathered during its operation through a monitoring system. For another part, it relies on metadata contained in initial
    BIM-compliant building design models. The resulting software application might be used in the future as an add-on to existing building management
    systems (BMS). Modern BMS are able to handle a huge amount of data that are analyzed for supervising, controlling and benchmarking buildings. BMS
    data are mainly gained through sensors and meters that provide information about e.g. the operational state of technical equipment, indoor
    temperature or energy consumption. Because of its highly time-dependent nature, this kind of information can be categorized as dynamic data about
    a building in contrast to static data which represent the building and its technical systems as they are i.e. as built physical entities. This
    latter kind of information encompasses data about the energy system components, their technical characteristics and their layout in the building.
    Even if numerous dynamic data are produced during building operation there is no much use of building static information created during its
    design. In view of that, the proposed methodology aims at closing this informational gaps between building design and operation by making reuse of
    initial design models serialized in IFC. The intrinsic relationships between dynamic and static data are then represented into some ontologies and
    analyzed by means of logical reasoning. In existing BMS those relationships are semantically poor and only contained partially in the backend data
    model of the BMS, like a relational database in most cases. The proposed semantic building information model is then used for interpreting
    building energy system behaviors and identifying best energy conservation measures. More specifically, an energy system ontology together with a
    risk ontology are introduced to support reuse of knowledge for optimized building operation.},

    tool was created to compute the thermal comfort of the OSH using the PMV/PPD method. The results indicate that a com-mon data structure for static

  abstract     = {What we're looking for in this proposal is a way to simplify the delivery of ICDD containers, following the ISO-21597. Considering
    the great value of delivering AECO projects based on open standards in a future-proof way, ICDD containers prove to be an important tool towards
    this direction. However, to raise the level of adoption of such initiatives, there is a lot of space for making the process more accessible to a
    wider range of users. Our contribution is targeting the end-to-end procedure of producing the ICDD container in a painless way for non-experts
    through a simple web-based interface, together with an API for developers. More specifically our approach is split into three main steps: 1) After
    the user specifies the directory with all the (local) project files, a Python script produces the ISO-defined file structure, while parsing all
    the available metadata from the files. 2) Then, the user adjusts the parsed information and fills up the rest, while defining links between the
    files. 3) The information, which is initially registered as an associative array, is processed and transformed into an RDF graph. The interface is
    designed in a way that guarantees the appropriate usage of the ontology’s entities and relations, as well as the proper literal data types without
    the explicit definition by the user. Additionally, SHACL will be used in the final processing step to verify the compliance to the ISO ontology.
    The whole directory, having been suitably configured, is zipped into the ICDD format. Furthermore, the backend code can be exposed through a
    standalone API, which accepts a properly formatted JSON file and produces the “index” and “linkset” RDF files. The API is considered especially
    useful for projects involving a big amount of files with repetitive link patterns, where batch data processing is more feasible than manual
    configuration. This option can also be considered as additional to step “2”, through the injection of the extracted link information to the
    interface. Finally, we are looking closely at approaches that aim to combine the ISO-21597 with broader data linking projects like openCDE etc. We
    would also like to open the discussion on how additional synergies with more low-level ontologies like BOT or BRICK can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {Managing infrastructure assets — street furniture, buildings, escalators, landing guidance systems, toilet doors — requires data
    that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable: FAIR data. Making this happen is a huge challenge. But succeed and you get much more
    value from your assets. By optimizing the planning of maintenance work, Dutch rail infrastructure company ProRail managed to cut maintenance cost
    by 10\%. Data can yield enormous value but making them FAIR takes effort. In this presentation, we report some of the results of a small-scale
    proof of concept called SIDO and will demonstrate the core functionality of the solution we created. It shows that projects to make data FAIR can
    be small in scope and still yield immediate benefits. Thus, the FAIR data challenge can be met in a stepwise manner. The SIDO-case is about
    sharing data between parties that do work under ground. Better methods of sharing data make it possible to better coordinate planning. The result
    is that a street needs to be closed for digging only once, while multiple parties execute their maintenance work on their separate underground
    assets. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management took the initiative for the project and funded it, and it was executed with Evides,
    the water company of the Rotterdam region, and other parties that own underground assets in the same area. Together with CGI, we at Taxonic
    realized a solution based on free open-source components, delivering a prototype of a SIDO-cooperation space based on FAIR data. Data science
    techniques are promising, but creating FAIR data already starts yielding benefits even when more modest goals are pursued. FAIR data can lead to
    significant improvements in essential, basic primary processes where data science plays no role (yet). To introduce FAIR data in an organisation,
    small incremental steps can be taken, each with a solid business case. This is what the SIDO-case is about. Utility companies must be able to gain
    access to their equipment under ground. These works need to be coordinated to minimize cost and traffic disruption. There is a great potential for
    cooperation, and of course efforts are made to make this happen — in the past and present. But cooperation is easier said than done. Data about
    underground assets are sensitive and not to be shared irresponsibly. We created a FAIR data solution to support this. The essential ingredient of
    the solution is a semantic data model in RDF, including some OWL and SHACL. When asset owners publish data about planned works conforming to this
    semantic model, other asset owners can instantly see with whom they might cooperate when planning their works. We will relate the SIDO case to
    other real-world developments in the asset management domain where RDF-based solutions play a central role. Also, we will demo the functionality
    of the SIDO solution.},

    seen an increase in the amount of computer software, technologies, and automation to help improve all facets of the industry. This new era of
    technologies is enabling transformative change in the way our communities are interacting among themselves and with the built environment. The
    Internet of Things (IoT), cyber infrastructure, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are among the new transformative changes that produce
    and share information from all the connected devices and technologies enabling Smart Cities and Intelligent Jobsites. With the increase of such
    innovations, seamless information exchange between the connected technologies within the different domain facets is a major need. The purpose of
    this workshop was to provide a focused overview on technical and applied research on the usage of semantic web, linked data, and web of data
    technologies for the AECO industry. The workshop aimed at gathering researchers, industry stakeholders, and standardization bodies of the broader
    Linked Building Data (LBD) community. This includes the buildingSMART Linked Data Working Group (LDWG) participants, the W3C Linked Building Data
    (LBD) Community Group participants, and others.},

  abstract     = {The Special Issue of Automation in Construction is about why and how to use the Web of Data technologies ({RDF}, {OWL}) for building
    information management ({BIM}). The article by Radulovic and colleagues, Guidelines for Linked Data Generation and Publication: an Example in
    Building Energy Consumption, focuses on making a set of guidelines available regarding the proper generation and publication of linked data,
    aiming specifically at the context of energy consumption in buildings. The article by Terkaj and Sojic, Ontology-based Representation of {IFC}
    {EXPRESS} rules: an enhancement of the {ifcOWL} ontology, gives a detailed indication of how the recent actions towards the development of an
    {OWL} version of the {IFC} schema can be extended to consider {IFC} {EXPRESS} rules. Costa and Madrazo combine both types of information in their
    article, named Connecting building component catalogues with {BIM} models using semantic technologies: an application case for precast concrete
    components, aiming to assist the design team in the assembly and dimensioning of structural components during the project phase. The third article
    included in this Special Issue is presented by Corry and colleagues, entitled, A performance assessment ontology for the environmental and energy
    management of buildings. In this article, an investigation is made of the ways in which semantic web technologies can be used to combine all sorts
    of energy-related data in buildings, so that the performance gap between measured and simulated energy performance level of a building can be made
    to increase.},
