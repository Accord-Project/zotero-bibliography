  abstract = {Imbalance between consumption and supply in grids causes a challenge to electricity utilities, leads to grid instability and results in failures of the grid. Traditionally, the demand for power is satisfied by increasing supply which is costly and against environmental regulations. Instead, demand response strategy harmonises the demand at the customer side e.g the utilities offer rates to customers to reduce their consumption at specific times of the day. While most research focuses on finding a strategy on just one side in this work, we approach it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning based methodology such that optimal strategies for parties are achieved with training on historical records. Agents are trained for individual customers and the electricity utilities for finding the optimal policies for the consumption, hence manifesting a multi-agents and multi-tiers approach. The new method achieves the full potential of a proactive framework for implementing the demand response strategy.},

  abstract = {Construction projects have temporary fragmented supply chains that face many challenges, such as lack of trust, inadequate knowledge management, and poor communication. These challenges led to poor performance in terms of low productivity, high cost, schedule delay, and poor quality. Construction is a conservative industry resists changes to its structure and adoption of technology and new management principles. The study aims to develop a value stream mapping and information management frameworks for construction projects. The developed frameworks can support the elimination of wastes and facilitate the integration of the construction supply chain, which ultimately reduce the project’s cost and lead time. It can also support the current shift towards Industry 4.0, which targets the enabling of Construction 4.0. Surveys and interviews are conducted to determine existing tools to exchange information, the extent of value stream mapping (VSM) adoption, and the key performance indicators in Alberta. The results show Alberta’s industry mainly depends on face-to-face discussions, phones, and emails to exchange information. The knowledge most likely stays at the individual levels and neither shared nor stored and poorly managed. This hinders knowledge capitalization, as well as the integration of the value chain network. Alberta’s construction industry hasn’t adopted lean management tools yet, and no common key performance indicators (KPIs) are established. Case studies are completed to implement VSM in procurement case studies. The results show traditional VSM can efficiently identify wastes in the current state of repetitive construction processes and eliminate them in future ones. The study proposed a new VSM framework for non-repetitive processes, which is more suitable for onsite construction activities. The framework is implemented in case studies. The results show significant improvements in terms of reducing wastes and the project’s lead time. The construction industry lacks standard methodology for ontology development. The ontologies that have been developed in construction have a deficiency in a philosophical basis and built for a specific use, and for certain project types and phases. To support knowledge management, which can facilitate information flow in the construction supply chain, an ontology for construction knowledge is developed using the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) structure, ISO 12006-2 recommendations, and input from industry experts. BFO is a mature upper ontology. It provides a framework to build a complete ontology based on philosophical basis. An ontology for the VSM framework is also developed using the BFO structure, so it can be integrated with the construction knowledge ontology. The developed frameworks can also support the industry’s current efforts to promote more collaborative project delivery approaches},

As a response, Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are increasingly being studied, evolved, and carried out during design processes of building projects. A practical approach to automate building LCA/LCC is using BIM software to automatically map materials in a Building Information Modeling (BIM) model to Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and cost databases. However, these approaches often produce unreliable results due to using the material names in the BIM model to match in databases. That leads to inaccurate LCA/LCC analysis. This paper aims to propose a bottom-up material mapping approach, ensuring fast and accurate mapping of the materials. A tool will be developed in collaboration with two Danish sustainability consultants in architecture and engineering, and is empirically evaluated on a large Danish housing project in Aarhus, Denmark.},

Every LOD comprises requirements for both Level of Geometry (LOG) and Level of Information (LOI). Thus far, the  validation of LOD is limited to the LOI, whereas, checking the quality of the LOG is a complex and  unsolved task. This paper proposes a framework for validating the LOG of building elements. In  more detail, a LOG dataset is modelled, and then a formal metric is defined based on an extracted  set of geometric features. Finally, a random forest model is developed for predicting the LOG.},

  abstract = {Building classification systems have established standard terminology and semantics for the construction sector. It is critical to use classification systems when dealing with specifications, structuring of documents and cost estimation. Classifying building product models in a standard way is a major step in organizing building product libraries. By giving the proper classification code to the product models, they can be arranged for different purposes such as cost estimation. However, several classification systems have been developed across the globe such as Uniclass in the UK and OmniClass in North America. Each system has been developed for a different purpose since the same collection of objects can be classified with different criteria. This paper studies four classification systems that are being used for classifying building product models. We structured four specific criteria to study these classification systems. We first argue that each criterion has a major role in defining different classification systems. These four criteria are: purpose and properties of the classification system, framework of the system, grouping principle within the system, organization and taxonomies of tables. Then considering these criteria, a comparison among the selected classification systems is presented.},

  abstract = {The large volume of in- and out-flow of raw materials to construction projects has a huge potential to be optimised for resource efficiency and waste reduction. With the recent awareness of the importance of the circular economy, construction actors are aligning their practices to be more circular and sustainable. The concept of material banks is born out of this awareness in order to document the lifecycle information of materials and facilitate re-using them. The introduction of new cycles before individual materials reach their final lifecycle stages results in reduced negative environmental impacts. This paper presents a workflow by positioning different digital technologies to automate the procedures for reuse assessment: from the deconstructed building to M/C bank to new construction projects. This automation supports a practical material and component reuse, while it provides the necessary infrastructure to digitise and digitalise the post-deconstruction materials to be visualised, selected and used by future designers in Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based design and management environments. To this aim, the coupling of BIM, reality capturing technologies, additive manufacturing techniques, IoT and RFID sensors is also anticipated.},

From an operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall” research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation.,The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and reduces material wastage.,This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-a-vis theoretical) level. Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures.},

This paper discusses a framework for automatic merging of heterogeneous data to create a visualization. The paper describes developing an ontology which captures concepts related to the visualization process. Then, heterogeneous data sources that are commonly used in construction are fed into the ontology which can be queried to produce different visualization scenarios.

These guidelines list “logic” as an essential control metric, and they require planners to ensure their schedules are free of missing or wrong logical dependencies. Checking the logic requires extensive construction domain knowledge, and planners perform it entirely manually as there are no available software solutions that support it. This paper offers a novel machine learning-based solution that learns construction scheduling domain knowledge from existing records completely automatically and applies it to validate the logic in input schedules achieving an F1 score of 88.3\%. Furthermore, we tailor our method to use the learned knowledge to schedule a list of unordered activities. The details of the method, experimental results, benefits, and limitations are discussed.}

  abstract = {BIM-enabled building code compliance is expected to become an essential component of future building construction practices. The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the adoption of building information modeling (BIM). BIM allows project stakeholders to more effectively define, communicate, and address issues. Yet there are areas in the construction industry not yet taking advantage of the full potential of BIM. For example, the building code development and compliance checking process has yet to be integrated with BIM on a large scale. Numerous attempts have been made to automate code compliance indicating that automation is an aspiration in the industry. One impetus for this movement is that previous and current processes surrounding development of and compliance with building codes and design standards has become increasingly cumbersome over the past three decades. Recent improvements in processing power have allowed advances in BIM technology using machine learning. In an industry that is seeking ways to increase productivity, changing the current code development and compliance checking processes by incorporating BIM and machine learning would have a significantly positive impact on the industry. This paper examines issues around transformation of the code development and compliance process.},

  abstract = {The Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG) is an ontology for attaching geometry descriptions to their corresponding things (e.g. building objects). The OMG is designed to provide three levels of adding the geometry descriptions which can be used and combined flexibly. The levels are designed to enable the attachment of metadata and comprise of the following functionalities: - Level 1: Direct connections between things and their geometry descriptions using either an object property for RDF-based geometry descriptions or a datatype property for non-RDF-based geometry descriptions resp. links to external files. - Level 2: Introduction of an intermediate node between the things and their geometry descriptions. By reifying the geometry description, handling of multiple geometry descriptions of the same things is empowered, metadata (as tags) can be added and dependencies between geometries can be modelled. - Level 3: Introduction of an intermediate node between the reified geometry and the geometry description to add geometry states. Thus, the version history of a geometry description can be described and stored.},

  abstract = {What we're looking for in this proposal is a way to simplify the delivery of ICDD containers, following the ISO-21597. Considering the great value of delivering AECO projects based on open standards in a future-proof way, ICDD containers prove to be an important tool towards this direction. However, to raise the level of adoption of such initiatives, there is a lot of space for making the process more accessible to a wider range of users. Our contribution is targeting the end-to-end procedure of producing the ICDD container in a painless way for non-experts through a simple web-based interface, together with an API for developers. More specifically our approach is split into three main steps: 1) After the user specifies the directory with all the (local) project files, a Python script produces the ISO-defined file structure, while parsing all the available metadata from the files. 2) Then, the user adjusts the parsed information and fills up the rest, while defining links between the files. 3) The information, which is initially registered as an associative array, is processed and transformed into an RDF graph. The interface is designed in a way that guarantees the appropriate usage of the ontology’s entities and relations, as well as the proper literal data types without the explicit definition by the user. Additionally, SHACL will be used in the final processing step to verify the compliance to the ISO ontology. The whole directory, having been suitably configured, is zipped into the ICDD format. Furthermore, the backend code can be exposed through a standalone API, which accepts a properly formatted JSON file and produces the “index” and “linkset” RDF files. The API is considered especially useful for projects involving a big amount of files with repetitive link patterns, where batch data processing is more feasible than manual configuration. This option can also be considered as additional to step “2”, through the injection of the extracted link information to the interface. Finally, we are looking closely at approaches that aim to combine the ISO-21597 with broader data linking projects like openCDE etc. We would also like to open the discussion on how additional synergies with more low-level ontologies like BOT or BRICK can be achieved.},

Several inspections and maintenance actions take place within these processes during which different actors collect, digitize and exchange bridge and damage information. Currently, inspection and maintenance practice relies on paper based data collection and exchange, which is time consuming and error prone. A way of storing and exchanging damage data in a digital format would lower the costs as well as support future needs, e.g. automated maintenance planning, structural integrity analysis and mixed reality inspections. A majority of damages are physical damages, like cracks and spalling. This paper presents two different approaches to model physical damages using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). Finally, the modelling concepts are tested with multiple BIM applications. Although the tests show that IFC is capable of modeling physical damages, current software tools do not support IFC up to its full potential.},

  abstract = {To achieve energy-efficient design in urban communities, the design phase needs to adopt reliable energy modeling approaches. However, current urban modeling approaches often use abstract and low level information to describe buildings because of the difficulties of collecting and managing building data on the large scale required of such urban communities. This abstraction of building data creates large uncertainties in the modeling and simulation of energy scenarios at the community level. An important part of the solution to this challenge relies on the integration of information systems at the scale of both urban communities and individual buildings, which are based on geographic information system (GIS) and building information modeling (BIM) respectively. Since current technologies do not sufficiently address the interoperability between GIS and BIM, the existing conversion between GIS and BIM does not satisfy the data requirements for community energy design. This paper investigates this challenge and presents an approach that uses semantic web technologies, including web ontology language (OWL) and resource description framework (RDF), to integrate GIS and BIM data. In this approach, we use an extract, transform and load (ETL) tool to convert GIS and BIM data to RDF and conduct queries on the integrated RDF to provide the required information for energy simulation. The approach is tested through a case study of the University of British Columbia campus.},

  abstract = {Commercial buildings have long since been a primary target for applications from a number of areas: from cyber-physical systems to building energy use to improved human interactions in built environments. While technological advances have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema which would reduce the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different buildings. Recent attempts have sought to address this issue through data standards and metadata schemes, but fail to capture the set of relationships and entities required by real applications. Building upon these works, this paper describes Brick, a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight complex unmodified applications on these buildings.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the ISO/IEC 81346 Standard series which defines a Reference Designation System (RDS). It is used to create a Reference model with unambiguous identifiers representing system breakdowns of systems and their elements in different views called aspects. The relations among the system elements, both inside each aspect as well as across aspects i.e., relations among systems of systems, then gets an unambiguous Reference designation, which is used for Reference purposes. The views are stored in a common Reference model, which holds systems and their elements and their relations for the purpose of being referred to unambiguously from any other representation of a system for example a model. The RDS Reference model thereby offers a discipline neutral model representing a system in its purest form as well as designations which allows for referencing to and from any system in it as well as the system relations within the model. As selected use case, the Digital Design, Manufacturing \& Services (DDMS) digitalization project at AIRBUS S.A.S. (Toulouse, France) has started to use RDS since 2017 and share their positive observations and conclusions to support the RDS 81346 Technique in this paper.},

  abstract = {The concept of automated checking can bring tangible advantages including increased efficiency and a reduction in the costs of compliance checking. The D-COM Research Network was formed to meet the clear need for research and leadership in this area. Through this initial research, DCOM has shown that the concerns raised in the Hackitt review of responsibility and departures from regulations is a systemic problem. There has been a significant rise in the formation of government expert groups to address some of these failings. DCOM is proposing not simply “plugging the leaks”, but a transformation of the regulatory compliance system. Digitising and automating this system will instil transparency and inherently build in the “Golden Thread”. The entire lifecycle of the built environment is governed by a variety of regulations, requirements and standards. The checking of compliance against these is a complex task, which is currently performed manually, thus becoming highly resource intensive. Recently, the increased maturity of information models and data and with the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) processes, means automation of compliance checking is becoming feasible. Our vision follows two pathways, the first, where we determined the State of the Nation and its views of automated compliance checking. Secondly, to engage with key stakeholders who inform and drive regulatory policy. In following these pathways, we have started to build • growing a community • defining the capabilities required to deliver automated compliance checking • developing a roadmap to deliver a working and operating model Our work focused around three key themes. These themes were Technology, Commercial and Political impacts on the reception of digitisation and automation of compliance checking. This report describes the outcomes from of this work. The key output of the work is the D-COM 2025 roadmap. Our roadmap offers a comprehensive and methodical list of next steps. This is a plan for the next 6 years that brings the UK to the verge of mass industrialisation of automated compliance checking by 2025. Our roadmap is organised into four phases. These include a phase of research, a pilot or proof of concept, a phase of industrialisation, where technologies developed for the pilot are matured and designed for scalability, and finally, commercial adoption.},

  abstract = {A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real building data stored in an industry specific format (the IFCs). The adoption of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of the regulation scheme within 18months. We believe that these positive results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible benefits.},

  abstract = {Linking heterogeneous information models from the domains Building In-formation Modelling (BIM) and Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) enables syner-getic effects between these domains. A common approach to define links between corresponding objects are identity relation like owl:sameAs from the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Identity relations suggests that everything stated about one entity hold for the corresponding entity (i.e., they share all of their properties). However, this kind of semantics is too strict for linking objects from heterogeneous information models. This paper shows the issue of the strict semantics of identity relations for linking build-ing elements of heterogeneous information models like Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML. In more detail, related literature about heterogeneities and links between IFC and CityGML are reviewed. Afterwards, the issue caused by the strict semantics of identity links for linking IFC and CityGML models is illustrated and al-ternative approaches to identity links are discussed. As a result, identity links are prone to be misleading for linking building elements represented in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML models. However, alternative linking approaches have the short coming that they generally rely on the correct interpretation of the user.},

In this paper, we are introducing a light-weight approach that allows the flexible extension of the IFC model with RDF vocabularies and ontologies. Using real-world quay wall models from the port of Rotterdam we show how information from multiple networked data sources can be seamlessly integrated with IFC models as the main carrier of geometric representation. We demonstrate how these semantically enriched models can be used with unmodified legacy software systems to facilitate a number of interoperability scenarios throughout different lifecycle phases.},

These cover the areas of the general conceptual architecture, governance strategies for the content, accessibility and interfaces, as well as technical aspects of implementations and others. In this paper, the ongoing collaborative work on a harmonized framework for networked, distributed concept libraries is introduced and discussed. It is shown how such systems may be used to expose the concepts for semantic mash-up scenarios in the context of the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative. A number of use-cases that demonstrate the potential applications of such systems in various interoperability scenarios are illustrated and discussed.},

Deficient semantic interoperability between BIM applications is one of the factors causing the industry dissatisfaction. The IFC schema is the open, international, vendor agnostic standard for data exchanges between BIM applications. It is a generic, rich and flexible standardized data model. However, the IFC specification lacks formal rigidness to unambiguously capture the full semantics needed for seamless and reliable information exchanges. A framework for new approach to overcome that drawback and improve the overall semantic interoperability is outlined in the paper. The novelty of the approach is that it places the onus for interpretation of exchanged data on an importing application which is an opposite to current practices when an exporting application is responsible for a semantic content of IFC exchange file. A pilot technical implementation was developed to test the applicability of the approach.},

The industry foundation classes (IFC) exchange schema is too generic to capture the full semantic meaning needed for direct use by different construction project stakeholders’ BIM tools. Although BIM standards that prescribe model view definitions (MVD) for domain-specific exchanges are under development, insufficient semantic definition of exchanges prevents achievement of the full potential of BIM through seamless interoperability. We propose an innovative approach for supplementing an IFC exchange file with semantically useful concepts inferred from the explicit and implicit information contained in the building model. A prototype software was implemented to test the applicability of the approach. It consists of a rule-processing engine and allows composition of inference rule-sets that can be tailored for different domains. The tests demonstrate semantic enrichment with precast concrete building models, adding inferred joint, slab aggregation and connection concepts.},

Through knowledge models such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of N3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web.},

While some building code clauses are straightforward, requiring direct checking of parameter values, others depend on the topological relationships among objects, making automated checking of BIM models more challenging. Moreover, existing applications require the user to extensively preprocess the model in preparation for checking. We propose applying semantic enrichment for pre-processing the BIM models. The goal of a semantic enrichment process in support of automated code compliance checking is to derive the needed clause test values automatically and to represent them explicitly. A successful semantic enrichment process can therefore widen the scope of requirements that can be checked automatically. This work demonstrates such a process for checking code clauses involving topologically complex requirements. Although semantic enrichment proved to be successful for several purposes in previous research, dealing with complex topologies involves different types of semantic enrichment tasks. We explore the subject through a test case of requirements from the Israeli code for security rooms.},

Semantic enrichment using artificial intelligence (AI) can automate much of this normalization process. Progress in the field of semantic enrichment, in turn, requires identification and specification of the information types that must be made explicit, and of the procedures appropriate for each type. After characterizing a broad set of clauses from five diverse building codes, a two-stage clustering process with the k-means algorithm was used to derive a hierarchical classification of semantic enrichment task types. The resulting classification defines 10 tasks that are typically needed for automated code compliance checking. Future research can build on the classification to formalize a knowledge base to inform selection of appropriate approaches for semantic enrichment tasks.},

We consider the use of ontologies to be better suited for representing such complex systems, paving the way toward semantic digital twins of the construction site by including concepts beyond traditional 3D model data, such as actors, sensors, management workflows, information over the web, etc. Most importantly, access to web distributed resources can be used for intelligent processing and logic reasoning, bypassing the BIM legacy tools and formats which are becoming more and more limited in an increasingly interconnected world. To address these challenges, we propose a 4D BIM platform architecture that is able to encompass semantic web models representing the building and the construction scheduling information, which are further enriched by the semantics of collaboration planning meeting contexts. The system architecture is comprised of several layers, each of which are presented and discussed.},

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.},

Ontologies provide a precisely defined vocabulary to build a common and shared conceptualisation of the energy domain. Here, we present the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) developed for the domain of energy systems analysis. Using the OEO provides several benefits for the community. First, it enables consistent annotation of large amounts of data from various research projects. One example is the Open Energy Platform (OEP). Adding such annotations makes data semantically searchable, exchangeable, re-usable and interoperable. Second, computational model coupling becomes much easier. The advantages of using an ontology such as the OEO are demonstrated with three use cases: data representation, data annotation and interface homogenisation. We also describe how the ontology can be used for linked open data (LOD).},

  abstract = {User requirements, building codes, construction rules and regulations imply constraints on a building design. Additional constraints are introduced by the different participants of the collaborative planning process through the individual body of knowledge representing their particular domain. Checking digital building models for compliance with these constraints allows detecting design errors and conflicts in an early stage. To realize this, all constraints have to be represented in a computer-processable form. However, many regulations and codes make use of higher spatial concepts, such as "must contain", "must be above". Today, such constraints can only be implemented by software experts using advanced geometry algorithms. In order to facilitate the definition of spatial constraints for common users, the paper introduces the concept of providing predefined metric, directional and topological operators as ready-made building blocks. The paper discusses in detail a proposed extension of the IFC constraint framework to include these spatial operators and describes procedures for embedding spatial constraint checks in the collaborative planning process.}

In this context, spatial reasoning technology can be applied in two different ways.

Second, we can check whether a con- crete building design is compliant with these constraints.

The architecture of BEM- Server, the design and use of OntoH2G in the solution, as well as the suitability of BEMServer as a middleware in the H2020 project Hit2Gap are described},

  abstract = {The AEC sector is known to be highly fragmented, different experts requiring different information. Current BIM collaborative practices can be described as static as they are based on file exchange, mainly using IFC files. Instead, in an ideal level 3 BIM platform, different stakeholders could work together on a single centralized building model, using different domain-specific vocabularies, and updating the model synchronously. We propose an approach based on semantic rule reasoning to dynamically convert information in different vocabularies. While existing alignments only cover class conversions, we develop inference rules that handle conversion of relations in a dynamic and transparent way, being executed by a reasoner. The approach is implemented and tested on converting models from ifcOWL to BIM4Ren, a BOT-based ontology. The scalability of the implementation is discussed as well as its limitation.},

Yet, its monolithic, non-modular structure makes it difficult to implement, extend and use. The need for an architecture that is easy to maintain, to extend, and to adapt to different types of projects and different types of buildings is becoming a challenge. We propose a new architecture for IFC, mainly based on a simple principle: multiple inheritance. We show how this approach can be used for a modular BIM, through the creation of modules in three different layers: (i) the view layer to identify elements in the building; (ii) the product layer to categorize those elements; (iii) and the domain layer to attach properties to elements. We compare our approach to existing and similar approaches , and we show how it can be used to build an IFC model for retrofitting.},

  abstract = {Regulations in the Building Industry are becoming increasingly complex and involve more than one technical area. They cover products, components and project implementations. They also play an important role to ensure the quality of a building, and to minimize its environmental impact. Control or compliance checking are becoming more complex every day for industrials but also for organizations in charge of assessing the conformity of new products or processes. This paper will detail the approach taken by the CSTB in order to simplify this compliance control task. The approach and the solutions proposed are based on semantic web technologies. For this purpose, we first elaborate a domain-ontology, which defines the main concepts involved and the relationships among them based on OWL. We rely on SBVR and SPARQL to reformulate the regulatory requirements written in natural language in a controlled and formal language. We structure then our control process based on expert practices. Each elementary control step is defined as a SPARQL query and assembled into complex control processes " on demand " according to the component tested and its semantic definition. Finally, we represent in RDF the association between the SBVR rules and SPARQL queries representing the same regulatory constraints.},

It highlights the impacts of using such new tools to fast renovation activities starting from the decision-making and design stages to the construction site management with the possibility to monitor occupants' and owners’ feedback during the realization process. In this process, a framework has been developed and implemented to allow stakeholders involved in a renovation project to efficiently compile, maintain, and add data about (i) building elements, (ii) building services systems, (iii) tenants, operators, and owners of the building, and (iv) current and predicted performance of the building from the various data sources available. The framework applies and specializes the existing practices in the Semantic Web, Linked Data, and ontology domain to the management of renovation projects. It has been designed to be open so that any system which implements the required functions and uses the specified conventions will be able to achieve semantic interoperability with other framework-compliant systems in the renovation domain. Finally, this book represents the validation process of the toolkit that has been held in three demo sites: a social housing building in Italy and two private residential buildings in Poland and Finland. The outcome shows that the toolkit facilitates the renovation process with relevant reductions of time, costs, and energy consumption and that the inhabitants can take advantage of the increase in building performances, quality, and comfort.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

  urldate = {2021-05-12},
  abstract = {This report is the result of a review commissioned by the buildingSMART International Regulatory Room. It explores the emerging future of automated rule checking (ARC). ARC is no longer just a “technical tool” needed to spot or study errors in design or work plans. Increasingly, research and applications of ARC are going beyond “box-ticking” compliance with regulatory rules. ARC is no longer just a cost-saving “software tool”, but a money-making “service or product”. Consequently, instead of the top-down, expert-system-like format, new forms of ARC are semantic-savvy, and are based on (bottom-up) analytics and machine learning approaches. ARC can now be used to automatically generate the analyses and/or services that consultants or contractors deliver. In fact, it can now (partially) be used to generate the design or work plans themselves. The interest in such types of ARC is a reflection of the growing importance and feasibility of AI (artificial intelligence), not just as an advanced form of sophisticated analysis tools, but as a driver for new business. The ability of using advanced AI approaches in these new types of ARC is a key outcome of the maturity of BIM in the industry. Thanks to IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), we now have a data-rich environment, where machine learning and pattern analysis can help us discover and use rules more effectively. Companies that master the inclusion, deployment and marketing of ARC capabilities will be more competitive in the new economy. Consequently, the “business value” of ARC is changing. It is poised to be a generator of services/ products not a quality control mechanism. Increasingly, it directly contributes to realizing new segments in the market. This ranges from products for automated analyses (including the automation of designs), to products for customization and delivery of information to customers (analysis-on-demand), to enhancing real-time management of sites and facilities (intelligent buildings). However, ARC value goes beyond the automation of some technical analyses within a digitized system (making more software more intelligent). More importantly, one of the key values of advanced forms of ARC is its role in organizational transformation. The sophisticated considerations and cultural changes needed to develop and deploy an ARC make it an effective linchpin for enterprise-wide AI initiatives. The expertise gained from implementing advanced ARC can be the best testbed for wider reengineering of business process, automation of workflow, and the deployment of business intelligence within the firm (or a facility). In other words, the sophistication of ARC implementation will propel the re-making of the firm not just its services. It changes the firm as it changes its offerings. To support better understanding of this new reality, this report aims to frame the business case for ARC, with three main considerations: 1) ARC is a form of machine learning system—it is not limited to an expert system tool; 2) ARC includes checking rule compliance and the generation of rules through data analysis; 3) because of its role in assuring the transformation of enterprises into  the AI-savvy economy, the business case analysis should reflect that. The business case should not be made only based on the interest of a technical team (cost savings through partial automation of some technical processes). Rather, it is to be made to an executive who is considering the customer needs and service offering and, indeed, the future, structure and strategy of the firm.},

It was reported that many more have recognized BIM and the AEC industry’s rapidly movement against more use of ICT tools in their processes. The conclusion from the meetings was that there is a need for common understandings were Government Regulatory Agencies together with the software industry and academia, can meet and share information, ideas and experiences and solve common issues together in the field of BIM in Regulatory processes. This guideline evaluates use case reports that introduce BIM in the process of building bSI RR meetings so far, and clarifies the development goals and key technologies typically required to implement BIM in the building regulatory process.

While traditional education and training of personnel offer well known approaches for establishing safe work practices, Serious Games in Virtual Reality (VR) are increasingly being used as a complementary approach for learning experiences. Their designs yet have to take full advantage of how players can manipulate and interact with virtual imagery generated by the computer. In addition, little of construction safety research has focused on generating and analyzing the inherent data that can be collected about the players. This research presents a novel framework for the generation and assessment of the player’s data in Augmented Virtuality (AV). The proposed approach is tested in a virtual work environment consisting of, next to a player carrying out a realistic work task, multiple hazards that are consistent within today’s construction sites. Sensors on construction tools augment the immersion of the player in the virtual scene in real-time and analysis of the collected data allow for rapid personalized feedback. Results on the experience of players are presented and discussed. An outlook presents future avenues towards enhancing existing education and learning methods and automating the proposed assessment method.},

In addition, the renovation process is a sequence of activities, withmany interlinked dependencies between several stakeholders, usually in a very fragmented market. All these drawbacks hinder the growth of this sector, which requires a comprehensive understanding to undertake the transformation of the sector.In  parallel,the  BIM  approach  has  proven  its  ability  to  provide  a  reliable  and  rich  enough  model  to perform  several  realistic  simulations  of  a  construction  project  since  the  design  phase  in  order  to support decision making processes.

Nevertheless, in the frame of the BIM4REN project, the initial version of the BIMfiles produced are most of the time very poor in terms of properties descriptions. Most of the time, only the structure and geometric aspect are present, which is not rich enough to envisage various renovation scenarios. The present tool will allow industrials to publish their cataloguesof products in a way that make themcompatible with the other tools developed along the value chain of BIM4REN. These catalogues will be then reused to enrich the BIM with products coming along with their properties.This deliverable is from Subtask T4.4.1: Object catalogueservers and backends integration.},

  abstract = {Manually checking models for compliance against building regulation is a time-consuming task for architects and construction engineers. There is thus a need for algorithms that process information from construction projects and report non-compliant elements. Still automated code-compliance checking raises several obstacles. Building regulations are usually published as human readable texts and their content is often ambiguous or incomplete. Also, the vocabulary used for expressing such regulations is very different from the vocabularies used to express Building Information Models (BIM). Furthermore, the high level of details associated to BIM-contained geometries induces complex calculations. Finally, the level of complexity of the IFC standard also hinders the automation of IFC processing tasks. Model chart, formal rules and pre-processors approach allows translating construction regulations into semantic queries. We further demonstrate the usefulness of this approach through several use cases. We argue our approach is a step forward in bridging the gap between regulation texts and automated checking algorithms. Finally with the recent building ontology BOT recommended by the W3C Linked Building Data Community Group, we identify perspectives for standardizing and extending our approach.},

  abstract = {The number of documents generated in a construction project and stored in interorganizational information systems is significant. Since a large percentage of these project documents are generated in text format, methods for organizing and improving access to the information contained in these types of documents become essential to construction information management. Information classification schemes can be used for this purpose. They provide a common framework to enact document organization and information exchange among project members. Current systems for document management rely on manual classification methods controlled by human experts. Due to the widespread use of information technologies for construction, the increasing availability of electronic documents, and the development of systems based on project object models, manual classification becomes unfeasible. This paper presents a unique way to improve information organization and access in interorganizational systems based on automated classification of construction project documents according to their related project components. Machine learning methods were used for this purpose. A prototype of a document classification system was developed to provide easy deployment and scalability to the classification process.},

  abstract = {In AECO industry (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation), BIM methodology is consolidated as the most efficient way to design, build, operate, maintain and demolish infrastructures by i) achieving the digital representation of the infrastructure including geometric and non-geometric information, ii) allowing for a more efficient collaborative work among the different stakeholders and disciplines, and iii) covering all the phases in the infrastructure life cycle (from the planning and design up to the demolition). However, some disciplines are not properly integrated within the workflows of BIM methodology. Therefore, the related information is not properly integrated in the As-Built BIM model of the infrastructure and it is not shared among stakeholders following BIM standards. This is the case of the Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control activities accomplish during the planning, design and construction processes of the infrastructure life cycle. This is the challenged tackled by the R\&I project ICONYC developed by the Engineering Company CEMOSA, funded by the Spanish Government, and presented here. Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control are core activities for CEMOSA. In the ICONYC project, CEMOSA has developed a methodology to integrate such processes within the BIM workflow allowing for the digital transformation of these activities. This presentation will describe the i) Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control processes workflows; ii) the mobile apps for field data gathering (geotechnical drilling, surveys, inspections and samples) developed in SAP Fiori; iii) the apps for the information analysis (tests, incidences, communications, geotechnical layers, etc) developed on SAP ERP; iv) the apps for the generation of the Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control BIM models developed by means of APIs from XBIM and Revit and, v) the Common Data Environment (CDE) which allows the sharing of site information (including documents, BIM models, CAD drawings, inspection, surveys, samples, incidences…) and management information (tasks, milestones, communications, stakeholders…) among all the participants. The CDE has been developed based on SAP Fiori, Autodesk BIM360 and Autodesk Forge. In addition, it will be described the Data Model to store on SAP ERP the information related to the Quality Control (batch, inspections, surveys, check points, samples, tests, incidences, communications, etc.) and the Geotechnical Investigations (drillings, samples, tests, geotechnical layers, etc) as well as the mapping of said Data Model with the IFC classes schema and the definition of the property sets to store the relevant quality control and geotechnical information. The integration of Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control processes into the BIM methodology produce a more accurate As-Build BIM Model, including the actual characteristics of the infrastructure executed and allowing for a better traceability of the control processes carried out and, consequently, a greater guarantee on the debugging of responsibilities in possible future infrastructure ‘s pathologies as well as a reduction in the possible mistakes in the integration of geotechnical parameters and, therefore, achieving a more optimised foundation designs. All of this reverts in a better collaboration among all stakeholders in a more cost-effective way.},

The paper proposes a methodology to separate the knowledge about objects, spatial relationships, and constraints from the generative process. The separation between the knowledge in a domain and its possible practical uses is an important achievement of semantic technologies, because it grants access to a large body of knowledge, spanning various aspects and processes across buildings and cities, which is being codified into formal ontologies. The present study has reused existing knowledge from two established ontologies. An illustrative case-project demonstrates the suitability of the methodology for a complex layout planning problem, involving a large number of decision-makers, with multiple competing objectives and criteria. The system implements multidimensional visual interactive tools to assist designers, planners, and decision-makers in exploring the layouts and the criteria, to develop their confidence in what qualifies as a good and effective solution.},

  abstract = {The current digital fabrication workflow requires many iterations between design and manufacturing. Automated manufacturability analysis can reduce the number of iterations at the design stage. However, existing approaches that leverage design for manufacturing and assembly (DfMA) do not consider detailed product features and production capabilities. To address this limitation, this paper utilizes an ontology-based approach to connect design and manufacturing knowledge. The developed manufacturability analysis system (MAS) involves semantic reasoning to analyze manufacturability by combining feature-based modelling, production capability modelling and manufacturing rules. The system was tested on a timber panelized project to demonstrate complex manufacturability analysis capability. The testing proves that the system could provide real-time feedback to the designers, leading to fewer design iterations. Thus, the paper is a first step towards automated fabrication-aware design and the results from the study lay the foundation for future research on connecting knowledge for interdisciplinary rule checking},

In this work, a model to represent rules holding complex constraints is proposed and conveyed through an ontology.

These heuristics are used to drive the refinement process needed prior the compliance checking.

Other types of knowledge, such as those related to functional and behavioral aspects of design, remain tacit or described in ad-hoc terms by relying on structural properties as representational surrogates (e.g. geometry). The lack of a formal, model-based representation of functional knowledge limits the scope of semantics required to provide better computational support in performance-based building design. To address this problem, the research proposes the development of a representational framework for the functional and behavioral characterization of building elements based on the Functional Representation (FR) schema, and its formalization under the DOLCE foundation ontology. Part of this formalization has been translated into the Web Ontology Language to explore capabilities of DL reasoners to support inference of functional interdependencies affecting performance. An overview of the main theoretical background adopted is provided. Preliminary results and future lines of research are also presented.},

However, current understanding of the state-of-the-art green BIM research is still limited. In particular, a focus study on how BIM contribute to green building design through building performance analysis (BPA) is not available. This paper aims to provide systematic and comprehensive insights on current trends and future potentials of green BIM research by analyzing the existing literature with their research features (i.e. research backgrounds, goals, methods and outputs). In total, 80 publications have been collected, analyzed and discussed. The results show that among ten main BPA types, energy \& thermal analysis, green building rating analysis, and cost and benefit analysis are the most studied. However, wind \& ventilation analysis, acoustic analysis, and water efficiency analysis receive little attention. Moreover, more research focusing on integrated design analysis should be carried out for optimal design outcome. In addition, most of the collected literature research on the capability of data integration and analysis of green BIM tools, while their capability of visualization and documentation has limited examination. Furthermore, most researchers utilized one main software package while utilization of information exchange formats (IEF) is limited. To increase interoperability of green BIM tools, how different BIM authoring tools and IEFs can be utilized for BPA requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {High-performance districts and communities offer opportunities for reducing energy use, emissions, and costs, and can be instrumental in helping cities achieve their climate goals. The design of such communities requires identification of opportunities early on and their re-evaluation throughout the planning process. There is a need for energy modeling tools that connect 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) platforms to simulation engines, enabling detailed energy analysis of districts within the workflows and tools used by practitioners. This paper introduces the Dragonfly and URBANoptTM combined toolset that supports the creation of urban models from a range of geometry formats typically used by designers and planners, and provides an integrated pathway to simulate district-scale energy systems. The toolset is piloted by a global architecture and master planning firm to evaluate several key urban-scale technical questions for the design of a district in Chicago. The findings indicate that, while energy savings can be achieved through traditional architectural studies and enhancements to individual building efficiency, the modeling toolset helps identify additional savings and insights that can be achieved when considering district-scale energy systems. Finally, this study demonstrates how the Dragonfly/URBANopt toolset can integrate with master planning workflows, thereby enabling an iterative performance-based design process.}

  abstract = {With the advancement of scientific and engineering research, a huge number of academic literature are accumulated. Manually reviewing the existing literature is the main way to explore embedded knowledge, and the process is quite time-consuming and labor intensive. As the quantity of literature is increasing exponentially, it would be more difficult to cover all aspects of the literature using the traditional manual review approach. To overcome this drawback, bibliometric analysis is used to analyze the current situation and trend of a specific research field. In the bibliometric analysis, only a few key phrases (e.g., authors, publishers, journals, and citations) are usually used as the inputs for analysis. Information other than those phrases is not extracted for analysis, while that neglected information (e.g., abstract) might provide more detailed knowledge in the article. To tackle with this problem, this study proposed an automatic literature knowledge graph and reasoning network modeling framework based on ontology and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to facilitate the efficient knowledge exploration from literature abstract. In this framework, a representation ontology is proposed to characterize the literature abstract data into four knowledge elements (background, objectives, solutions, and findings), and NLP technology is used to extract the ontology instances from the abstract automatically. Based on the representation ontology, a four-space integrated knowledge graph is built using NLP technology. Then, reasoning network is generated according to the reasoning mechanism defined in the proposed ontology model. To validate the proposed framework, a case study is conducted to analyze the literature in the field of construction management. The case study proves that the proposed ontology model can be used to represent the knowledge embedded in the literatures’ abstracts, and the ontology elements can be automatically extracted by NLP models. The proposed framework can be an enhancement for the bibliometric analysis to explore more knowledge from the literature.},

The design decision-making for LCBs should consider various criteria which however are often associated with uncertain information. Little research has examined multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) in selecting LCB measures, particularly in high-density subtropical urban environments. That selection process is inhibited by the lack of consensus on assessing the performance of LCB options and of an efficient decision support system. The aim of this paper is to develop a BIM-integrated fuzzy MCDM model for selecting LCB measures. The paper identifies the key criteria and alternatives to systematically assess LCB measures. Five criteria and nine alternatives were identified within the context of high-rise commercial buildings in Hong Kong, which are centralized on technical, economic and environmental aspects of building performance. With the use of BIM and eQUEST, a MCDM model based on Fuzzy PROMETHEE is developed. The developed model is validated utilizing a real project case in Hong Kong. The results will provide design decision-makers with a consolidated tool for selecting LCB measures.},

Then we train Big Five classification models with these data and evaluate them with 2500 data from generated dialogues and real conversational datasets labeled in Big Five by human annotators. The results indicated that this approach is promising for creating effective training data. We then compare the performance by different training approaches and models. Our results suggest that using Adapter-Transformers and transfer learning from pre-trained RoBERTa sentiment analysis model will perform best with the generated data. Our best model obtained an accuracy of 0.71 in generated data and 0.65 in real datasets. Finally, we discuss this approach's potential limitations and confidence metric.},

  abstract = {Construction sites are hazardous with various potential hazards that can occur at any time. The combination of different factors always causes the construction fatalities, and the majority of these fatalities could be prevented if workers followed on-site regulatory rules. However, compliance of regulatory rules is not strictly enforced among workers due to all kinds of reasons. Although previously proposed vision-based approaches are available for occupational hazards identification, the practicality is limited by the lack of automated understanding and adaptability to regulatory rules changes. In response to these gaps, this paper proposes a novel graph-based framework that integrates linguistic and visual information to process regulatory rule sentences and images for on-site occupational hazards identification. Particularly, a regulatory rules processing approach is presented to automatically extract and represent the key linguistic information of regulatory rules and a vision-based image scene information understanding approach is introduced to process on-site images by the combination of deep learning-based object detection and individual detection using geometric relationships analysis. Additionally, an automated reasoning approach is proposed to provide the integration of the processed linguistic and visual information and perform hazards identification. The hazards of two scenes, i.e., “working on height” and “operating a grinder”, were successfully identified with significantly higher performance compared to the baseline model.}

However, their robustness and abilities to handle various complexities of the open world have yet to be explored, which is especially crucial in assessing the stability of models and is a key aspect of trustworthy AI. In this study, we perform a comprehensive experimental analysis of GPT-3.5, exploring its robustness using 21 datasets (about 116K test samples) with 66 text transformations from TextFlint that cover 9 popular Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. Our findings indicate that while GPT-3.5 outperforms existing fine-tuned models on some tasks, it still encounters significant robustness degradation, such as its average performance dropping by up to 35.74\textbackslash\% and 43.59\textbackslash\% in natural language inference and sentiment analysis tasks, respectively. We also show that GPT-3.5 faces some specific robustness challenges, including robustness instability, prompt sensitivity, and number sensitivity. These insights are valuable for understanding its limitations and guiding future research in addressing these challenges to enhance GPT-3.5's overall performance and generalization abilities.},

  abstract = {Metadata in most existing building automation systems (BASs) is inconsistent, incomplete, and nondescriptive. This situation is a major obstacle to the widespread use of data analytics to improve the operation of buildings. In this article, we put forward a method to infer zone-level metadata from features derived from BAS data. The method includes two steps: 1) classification of BAS points into different types (e.g., indoor temperature, indoor temperature set point, airflow, airflow set point, damper position, and radiator valve position) and 2) association of BAS points based on their functional relationships (i.e., grouping the sensors, actuators, and set points of each zone together). The metadata inference method was demonstrated with data from zones served by four different air handling units (AHUs) in two office buildings in Ottawa, ON, Canada. The results from this case study indicate that common zone-level BAS point types can be accurately classified and associated even in the absence of intuitive data labels. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the problem of metadata normalization in existing buildings, in order to scale up the application of smart building solutions in the real world. Existing metadata normalization approaches mainly focused on inferring the point types of the metadata with both semantic (label) and numerical information (time series readings). In this article, we put forward a method to infer zone-level metadata with numerical information only. Methods for both types of classification and relationships' association of the BAS points are investigated. The results from two office buildings indicate that the classification phase can achieve an average of 90\% accuracy, while the association phase can obtain an average of 85\% accuracy. The method was developed and demonstrated with a limited data set by using data exclusively from zone-level sensors, actuators, and set points. Future work is planned to extend the proposed method to more comprehensive BAS data sets with the system- and plant-level data as well.}

Conventional methods for  crack detection have limitations in terms of robustness or requiring a large training database. To  achieve the goal of structural damage detection that can be used to reconstruct the 3D as-damaged  geometry of a disaster site, this research proposes an unsupervised learning method to perform crack  segmentation directly from LiDAR-scanned point cloud data. First, column segments are extracted  from the building façade by region growing and rule-based filtering. Next, five different types of  point features are extracted, namely RGB color, intensity, normal vector, curvature, and neural  network-based features. Then, K-means clustering is used to isolate the cluster of points belonging  to the cracked region. The effectiveness of the proposed method is measured quantitatively using  the precision and recall metrics and qualitatively by visualizing the segmentation results compared  to the ground truth. Experimental results show that the neural network-based features achieved the  best performance in terms of precision and recall.},

This data model, based on E-R model with deep object class instance hierarchy for both elements and relationships has presented challenges in implementing scalable database approaches for managing and serving BIM objects while maintaining requisite relationships necessary for inferring relationships across the complex E-R network. Alternative models based on alternative data encodings with associated data topologies, database strategies and supporting tool sets such IFCXML, IFCJSON and RDF/IFCOWL have been proposed, with associated affordances and limitations in terms of semantic richness, validation and querying capability and scalability. Graph databases are a recent development in modern databasing technology that is gaining prominence in the broader computing community. Graph databases promise general support of complex entity-relationship networks in a manner that supports rich semantic inference at scale. Consider those limitations stated above, this paper propose a method of database mapping between IFC Model to Graph database, and presents opportunities for drawing on graph querying capabilities to develop inferences about the semantic relationships among objects in IFC BIM models. The implementation and examination of this mapping is achieved by translating the IFC data and then store them into Neo4j, a commonly used graph database application. As part of this translation, broadly available IFC to XML conversion utilities were used to convert the BIM software output to XM. A python based parser was developed and used to parse the IFC component information and generate a Cypher script - the structural language for graph database construction.. This Cypher script - encapsulating the IFC E-R model is imported into the Neo4j graph database in batches with Neo4j-Shell.},

However, there are a lot of problems related to the development of a legality system due to the complexity of Korean regulations, relationships and structures, the inefficiency of designing a legality system based on 2D drawings, the duplication examinations of documents (soliciting forms for civil affairs), and the drawings themselves. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a legality system for building administration permission services based on open Building Information Modeling (BIM) in Korea. To achieve this purpose, the authors investigate the permission procedures and regulation structures used in current building administration permissions, then formulate an ideal permission procedure and regulation structure for the legality system in Korea. In addition, the authors investigate element technologies (for example, methods of structuring regulation, BIM model checker, BIM model viewer) for a legality system based on BIM and develop a prototypical legality checking software.

In this paper, we investigate the works published in the last decade addressing the use of BIM and PLM mock-ups in OHS risk prevention. Then, we compare these two kinds of mock-ups and identify the digitalized information that is integrated into risk management. It emerges that BIM-based OHS risk management mainly integrates information about site conϐiguration and task scheduling, while PLM-based OHS risk management mainly integrates information about task sequences and interactions between humans, products, and toolsȀequipment. Furthermore, BIM-based approaches are used mainly for managing occupational safety risks, while PLM-based approaches are used mainly for managing human factorsȀergonomics ȋHFȀEȌ risks. To avoid siloed approaches to manage OHS and provide more sustainable and systemic OHS risk mitigation measures, it is more suitable to merge the BIM and PLM approaches.

We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6\% increase in Precision@95\% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate "reasoning" in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance.},

Architectural firms have increasingly been adopting them, especially Virtual Reality (VR), but the technology is mainly employed as a means to showcase their finished projects to prospective clients. We posit that the use of the technology should be integrated as part of the design process itself. To verify that claim, we conducted an online survey on the potential of using VR for architectural design. We gathered 36 responses, that were contrasted with potentially influential factors such as the respondent’s prior experience with VR devices. We conclude that there is indeed a demand for a more complete integration of VR technology in architectural practice. We also investigated how VR could be employed for Algorithmic Design (also known as Parametric Modelling) and we put our findings in perspective with existing work. By sharing these findings, we hope to accelerate future efforts towards integrating VR solutions in the architectural and urban design process to address the needs identified through this survey.

The lack of interoperability between data domains in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry inhibits the cross-domain use of data at an enterprise level. Semantic web technologies provide a possible solution to some of the noted interoperability issues. Traditional methods of information capture fail to take into account the wealth of soft information available throughout a building. Several sources of information are not included in performance assessment frameworks, including social media, occupant communication, mobile communication devices, occupancy patterns, human resource allocations and financial information. The paper suggests that improved data interoperability can aid the integration of untapped silos of information into existing structured performance measurement frameworks, leading to greater awareness of stakeholder concerns and building performance. An initial study of how building-related data can be published following semantic web principles and integrated with other ‘soft-data’ sources in a cross-domain manner is presented. The paper goes on to illustrate how data sources from outside the building operation domain can be used to supplement existing sources. Future work will include the creation of a semantic web based performance framework platform for building performance optimisation.},

  abstract = {In the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, Building Information Model (BIM) authoring tools enable the creation of digital representations of buildings. Each tool implements its own building data model, which makes it difficult to achieve the desired interoperability when building data have to be exchanged with other software (e.g., building energy simulation tools). The representation of BIM models through open standards (e.g., IFC) and Semantic Web technologies can facilitate building data transformation in an automated and flexible way. This is achieved by taking advantage of the logical basis of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model and queries created in the Semantic Web query languages. The result is a pragmatic mechanism to transform the data from one data domain to another. This article analyses the potential of Semantic Web query languages to facilitate the data transformation of building data through different alternatives. The first contribution is the identification of fourteen data mapping patterns and three cases of data transformation that enable transforming one data model into another, considering the semantic and structural differences between them. The second contribution is the review and comparison of query languages to carry out the transformations through two different alternatives: using SPARQL-Generate and SPARQL Construct queries. And finally, the third contribution is the definition of a metric to assess the complexity of SPARQL queries.},

However, these systems and tools typically provide this support in isolation from each other. A good combination of these systems and tools is beneficial for a better coordination and information management. Semantic web technologies and a Linked Data approach can be used to fulfil this aim. In this paper, we indicate how these technologies can be applied for one particular objective, namely to check a building information model (BIM) and make suggestions for that model regarding the building elements. These suggestions are based on information obtained from different data sources, including a BIM model, regulations and catalogues of locally available building components. In this paper, we briefly discuss the results obtained in the application of this approach in a case study based on structural safety requirements},

The current  Building  Energy  Performance  (BEP)  simulation  tools  require  a  great  deal  of  time  and effort  because  data  from  multiple  sources  must  be  properly  combined  (e.g.,  building/urban models, ECM catalogues, weather condition files) in order to create energy simulation models. In addition, the process of manually setting up each scenario in order to obtain the most optimal solution  is  also  a  demanding  and  time-consuming  task.  The  growing  presence  of  the  Building Information   Model/Modelling   (BIM)   technologies   in   the   Architecture,   Engineering   and Construction  (AEC)  industry,  combined  with  the  new capabilities  to  link  and  integrate  data using  Semantic  Web  technologies,  is  presented  as  an  alternative  to  automate  the  simulation process.  In  this  article,  we  present  a  system  that takes  advantage  of  the  capabilities  of  these technologies  to  integrate  ECM  data  into  BEP  simulation  models  in  an  automated  way.  The system  is  composed  of  a  catalogue  of  ECM  measures  described  in  Resource  Description Framework (RDF) and a software component that facilitates their application in the models. The system has been developed in the context of OptEEmAL, a research project aimed at creating a web platform to facilitate building simulations at a district scale. The applicability of the system is demonstrated in a case study of a district-scale project.},

  abstract = {Ontologies have been great resources to share and exchange domain knowledge in the context of BIM. Ontologies define the logic and semantics needed for BIM applications by formally classifying entities in the domain including the types, properties, relationships and other significant attributes. One major benefit of using ontologies is that the information and knowledge defined with these ontologies can be shared across the various BIM applications without divulging proprietary information. However, major challenges exist with sharing and reuse of information due to the lack of consistency, redundancy, and potential errors. This chapter explores the development of ontologies, languages, and standards to highlight the applications and deployments of shared representations of building information models. The objectives include: 1) present an overview of knowledge management in a BIM context, including the status of available standards and data exchange approaches; 2) explain the details of ontology components and the Semantic Web stack, 3) discuss the development, reusage, and management of ontologies; 4) present current AEC ontologies that can be integrated with BIM be discussed; and 5) reflect on the limitations and open challenges regarding BIM and ontologies to promote future research. Major findings highlighted in this chapter include i) perfectly interoperable integrated systems will never be fully achieved since interoperability between systems and data structures always need to be made, in which those mappings always come with ‘interpretation errors’ or ‘data loss’, ii) integrating BIM tools with other data sets predominantly including time series databases (sensor data), GIS data, and complex 3D data, into a single data storage system is neither efficient nor desirable, and iii) BIM and digital twin applications needs support from Semantic Web and linked data. Significantly, recent research and developments suggest that BIM, even with current challenges, will expand to utilization that is yet to be envisioned.},

  abstract = {Within the operational phase buildings are now producing more data than ever before, from energy usage, utility information, occupancy patterns, weather data, etc. In order to manage a building holistically it is important to use knowledge from across these information sources. However, many barriers exist to their interoperability and there is little interaction between these islands of information. As part of moving building data to the cloud there is a critical need to reflect on the design of cloud-based data services and how they are designed from an interoperability perspective. If new cloud data services are designed in the same manner as traditional building management systems they will suffer from the data interoperability problems. Linked data technology leverages the existing open protocols and W3C standards of the Web architecture for sharing structured data on the web. In this paper we propose the use of linked data as an enabling technology for cloud-based building data services. The objective of linking building data in the cloud is to create an integrated well-connected graph of relevant information for managing a building. This paper describes the fundamentals of the approach and demonstrates the concept within a Small Medium sized Enterprise (SME) with an owner-occupied office building.},

Providing an intuitive organizational scheme,  location, camera orientation, and semantic content description metadata exploit the physical  structure of the existing building their photos represent. Location is inferred using Bluetooth beacons. Camera orientation is inferred from the device’s on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU).  Image content is inferred using automatic object recognition. As a user traverses the interior of a  facility, the photo library displayed on their mobile device is ordered by the proximity to the user’s  current location. A root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 meters is achieved for localization. This  ordering is refined using a query image’s camera orientation and image semantic content description.  The presented photo management application reduces the time required to find relevant historical  photos representing objects within a user’s vicinity.},

Knowledge about what entities and attributes to select is captured based on literature and investigating the pilot demonstration sites. Such an ontology can help to structure the surrounding data to support processes in different stages of the renovation. The final goal is to support planners in decision making process namely in site planning and pre-data collection phase, energy modeling, comfort analysis and so on to control cost and quality.

  abstract = {One of the characteristic features of object-based Building Information Models is the close integration of geometric and semantic information into one model. This concept is thoroughly implemented by the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), a comprehensive data model designed to provide a sound foundation for complex data exchange scenarios. Besides the provision of a large variety of data types for capturing the semantics of building elements and spaces, the IFC also makes it possible to define relationships between building elements and/or spaces, respectively. In particular, a spatial aggregation hierarchy can be modeled by successively applying the relationship IfcRelAggregates to space objects. However, no validation options currently exist to check whether the semantically defined aggregation hierarchy complies with the geometric setup of the individual spaces and building elements. This lack of consistency between the semantic and the geometric part of the BIM model may lead to serious data interpretation errors at the receiving end. To prevent this, we propose a new method for validating spatio-semantic consistency based on the usage of the Query Language for Building Information Models (QL4BIM) which on the one hand provides a means of accessing the IFC object model and on the other hand provides high-level spatial operators, such as Disjoint, Touching and Containing. The formulation of corresponding queries makes it possible to verify the spatio-semantic consistency of the IFC model. The paper discusses application scenarios and provides a number of relevant examples.},

To overcome this issue, we present a spatio-semantic query language that allows analysis of IFC building information models and geospatial CityGML models in an integrated context.

This is a major task for both designers and enforcers, often leading to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. Technical developments in Building Information Modelling (BIM) offer the potential for a new generation of software tools that can automate the checking of compliance with building codes, thus improving the efficiency of building design and procurement. To attain these efficiencies designers must change their working practices and move away from the definition of a building in multiple and disparate documents to a single coherent building model from which the documentation is generated. Theoretically, this building model could contain sufficient information to respond to interrogation at the level of building code compliance, though in practice only a percentage of the required information is normally present. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance, identifies the key issues for future development and examines the causes of information paucity for compliance checking in the current generation of BIM tools.},

  abstract = {The management and the identification of design changes constitute an essential part of the of a design flow within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, requiring the formalisation of a multi-disciplinary collaborative information modelling environment. Construction projects generate substantial amount of change information, which needs to be updated continuously throughout the process, from initial feasibility study to the decommissioning of facilities. Complications arise from the information storage in multiple incompatible file formats that can lead to the loss or omission of details. In addition to any unexpected changes, the mismanagement of information is another factor leading to delays and costly errors. In order to mitigate such issues, this paper proposes to integrate the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate and visually identify the result of change requests. The system is developed using C\# by 1) integrating angular framework with ASP.NET (Active Server Pages) to create a dynamic single web page and 2). Using X-BIM toolkit that supports IFC format to read, create and visualise the BuildingSmart Data Models (aka IFC Models). This approach enables a web-based platform capable of generating reports and visual previews, highlighting the differences between IFC files throughout the design processes. A web-based system prototype allows users to compare subsequent versions of IFC design models in terms of additions, modifications and deletions. The prototype uses NLP to intelligently identify the changes that have been made as it compares newer and older versions of the same model, making this information available to designers and 3D modellers. Prospective work will focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the implementation of changes within the construction models.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the recent emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications offer several new insights and decision-making capabilities throughout the life cycle of the built environment. In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies.},

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature to address this important issue from complementary perspectives, which are often hard to capture in a comprehensive manner. This survey article aims at providing a structured and unifying treatment of the existing literature on intelligent energy management systems in buildings, with a distinct focus on available architectures and methodology supporting a vision transcending the well-established smart home vision, in favor of the novel Ambient Intelligence paradigm. Our exposition will cover the main architectural components of such systems, beginning with the basic sensory infrastructure, moving on to the data processing engine where energy-saving strategies may be enacted, to the user interaction interface subsystem, and finally to the actuation infrastructure necessary to transfer the planned modifications to the environment. For each component, we will analyze different solutions, and we will provide qualitative comparisons, also highlighting the impact that a single design choice can have on the rest of the system.},

This DIN SPEC has been developed and approved by the authors named in the foreword of the DIN SPEC. DIN SPEC 91391-2 specifies the conceptual requirements for procedures and data structures for data exchange between CDEs or between a CDE and other software applications. Through a defined, lossless data exchange, the continuity of the data has to be ensured, even if CDEs of several vendors are involved during the lifecycle of abuilding. The requirements for CDE interfaces as well as protocols and structures for data exchange are specified. The requirements described here do not describe the syntax for a openCDE interface implementation. Interfaces of different manufacturers therefore generally differ syntactically, even if the conceptual requirements presented here are adhered to. An openCDE-compliant interface allows the target group-oriented compilation of information content. Through the specification of information requirements (BEP/EIR) due to information demand, information can be classified in a CDE so that actually needed information can easily be identified for the purpose of the use case of a target group. These can be aggregated in an information container and communicated via an openCDE interface. Examples from risk management and facility management are presented. The requirements for an openCDE-compliant interface focus on the container-based information exchange described in DIN SPEC 91391-1.The interface therefore does not include functionalities for exchanging the internal information of the containers. Depending on the type of container (e. g. IFC models or BCF communication), more specific interfaces may be offered by CDE providers, but are outside the scope of this DIN SPEC. Flexible and seamless data exchange between software products requires a standardized interface. The technical implementation of an openCDE interface should consider open standards for the specification of web interfaces (OpenAPI), for secure authentication methods (OAuth) and for the use of parameters for the search, sorting and filtering of queries according to specific criteria (OData). For this purpose, this DIN SPEC specifies requirements for a web-based dynamic interface that supports various application areas and is based on the REpresentational State Transfer API (REST). An appropriately implemented openCDE interface allows the dynamic connection and data exchange of different software product types (for example CDE, App, CAFM, CAD)},

Picking low hanging fruits might be one possible solution to make AEC practitioners interested in semantic web technology. Cost estimation has been a manual and repetitive task prone to human error. We investigate how semantic web technology can support BIM-based automated cost estimation and what challenges that can appear. Standardized specifications of work for Norwegian road projects (with process codes and process descriptions) were linked to an IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) property set by semantic web technology. Future projects that use the standardized specifications of work can adopt the established setup and thereby automate cost estimation with minimal efforts. This practical approach will accelerate the application of semantic web technology in the AEC industry to automate services.

This paper aims to define the state of the art on Natural Language Processing applications for the numerical translation of basic design requirements in the AECO sector. The major advantages of this research would be the optimization and automation of numerical definition and validation of requirements in a structured data form. Structured data can, in fact, be easily managed in a BIM approach. NLP supporting information modeling methods allows the application of requirements engineering and management techniques to handle construction processes from a data-driven perspective. An investigation of the setting of a decision support system, based on NLP, for the definition and validation of requirements in the early stages of the construction process, is also provided as a potential further development.},

Although there are various studies on alternative methods to quantify risk in  projects, limited research exists about how the results are utilized to make sense of project risk by  the decision-makers. Probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo Simulation involve an additional  complication as probability is an abstract concept and hard to interpret. We argue that blurred risk  pictures as well as lack of familiarity of the users with the concept of probability may lead to  misleading interpretations during risk assessments. The aim of this paper is to present the underlying  theoretical ideas behind a planned empirical research project with the goal to explore how results of  probabilistic risk assessment can be represented in a way that help decision-makers to understand  risk in a project and develop visuals that can be used by the decision-makers to see the entire risk  picture. Within the study we plan to analyze data from a case study on a mega tunnel project carried  out in Turkey, hypothesizing that interactive visualizations may help the user to understand the  inputs, outputs and assumptions in quantitative risk models, and help risk managers to understand  how project outcomes may change with changes in the risk picture. We hope that the outcomes of  the empirical research will allow us to develop better visuals for users to understand the potential  scenarios in a project, probability, variation and model uncertainty.},

Project information is composed by several documents among which graphical drawings traditionally represent a fundamental component. The fragmentation of this information along the construction process can be addressed with the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM). One of the fundamental components of BIM is the development of information models. These models contain a defined and shared semantic structure that allows the simulation of real entities in a digital environment. However, the quality of this simulation is bounded by the limits of the instruments used for its development. The work presented in this paper is the development a rules-based system that makes inference upon ontologies obtained from IFC models to recognise real estates units and their destination of uses starting from building information models.

Some of these tools have been implemented commercially and others are beginning to be adopted or are in their final stages of development. The paper also examines how readily these tools can be applied in the context of a performance-based code as found in New Zealand. Due to a recent push for innovation and productivity improvement in the AEC industry, there is an increased uptake of building information modelling (BIM) and the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) open standard data model for interoperability. The availability of high performance personal computers, efficient web-based technology, and new initiatives in legal knowledge representation modelling should make the development of commercial compliance checking systems more viable than ever. However, the quest for an industry agreed unified approach seems to be far from over. Research is being conducted to develop a computer interpretable representation of New Zealand’s performance-based codes using an open standard legal data exchange protocol. This is to be integrated into a web-based BIM compliance checking framework. The fire safety clauses of the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) are used in the case study.},

The first is to ensure that any form of computable representation is practical and relatively easy to use and maintain. The second is to ensure that performance-based regulatory compliance criteria, which are often qualitative in nature, are adequately addressed and correctly represented. This research proposes a method of automating manual compliant design procedures using an open standard executable workflow representation that can be specified and maintained relatively easily by a design engineer. This executable workflow is referred to as the compliant design procedure (CDP) and can be described graphically. When executed in a computing environment, a CDP can guide the compliance audit process by checking a given design represented in a model view or subset of the building information model (BIM), referred to as the building compliance model (BCM), against the criteria in a digital building code, referred to as the regulatory knowledge model (RKM), which is developed specifically for this purpose. This paper describes the process of modeling and encoding BCM, CDP, and RKM, which are independent input components of the proposed compliance audit system framework. Supplementary human input and the ability to exchange input and output data with external simulation tools to solve some of the more complex qualitative criteria are important features of the framework.},

Numerous work-around approaches have been proposed by researchers in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management (AEC/FM) domain over the last four decades to create computable representations of normative data that can be used to automate some of the processes in the domain. The transition from human-readable text to a structured representation can occur in many possible ways, eg through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, manual annotations, or through direct coding. In all cases, however, the human-readable document at the source remains the sole point of reference. Ideally, however, one digital structured representation should also be available and recognised as the single digital point of reference. Research in the AEC/FM domain has shown that automated compliant building design processes would benefit from a single standardised and manageable digital representation of normative data. Recent efforts in the legal domain have shown promising developments in legal mark-up languages such as LegalDocML and LegalRuleML as emerging open standards for legal knowledge interchange. In this article, we explore the potential of adapting these emerging standards to accommodate specific requirements of the AEC/FM domain.},

There have been numerous approaches to computer-aided compliance audit in the AEC/FM domain over the last four decades, but none has yet evolved into a practical solution.

  abstract = {The ingredients for an effective automated audit of a building design include a BIM model containing the design information, an electronic regulatory knowledge model, and a practical method of processing these computerised representations. There have been numerous approaches to computer-aided compliance audit in the AEC/FM domain over the last four decades, but none has yet evolved into a practical solution. One reason is that they have all been isolated attempts that lack any form of standardisation. The current research project therefore focuses on using an open standard regulatory knowledge and BIM representations in conjunction with open standard executable compliant design workflows to automate the compliance audit process. This paper provides an overview of different approaches to access information from a regulatory model representation.

  abstract = {The main challenges in automating the regulatory compliance checking of building engineering designs are the availability of computable representations of the building and the regulatory knowledge, as well as a system that can process and manage these representations effectively. The emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) at the start of the millennium has sparked useful research in the area of sharing building information effectively; but, challenges remain with producing a practical and manageable regulatory knowledge representation that can be processed effectively by a compliance checking system. Research is being conducted to develop a two-part regulatory knowledge representation which can be maintained independently by designers and regulators. One part is a set of compliant design procedures modelled as Business Process Diagrams (BPD) using an open standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The other part is the associated regulatory constraints and rules encoded in a computable format suitable for execution with the BPMN. This paper reports on a set of guidelines developed for the purposes of encoding regulatory knowledge into the proposed computable representation. A verification method (C/VM2) prescribed by the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) for the performance-based design of buildings related to fire safety has been selected as a case study to illustrate the encoding process. These guidelines are adaptable for encoding the entire NZBC.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an automated code checking system (DesignCheck) that enables quick and easy compliance assessment against building codes and assists designers in finding potential problems early. The system enables modelling of extended design information and encoding of a wider range of domain knowledge embedded in building codes. It uses Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) as a common model to transfer 3D object-based CAD models to the DesignCheck internal model. The DesignCheck internal model allows for the definition of comprehensive design information as well as identical description mapping onto building codes. Building codes are interpreted using an object-based representation and then encoded into object-based rules using Express language. A geometry engine and semantic interpretation are used in the DesignCheck system to support design performance verification. The system allows for checking designs at the different stages – sketch design, detailed design and documentation. It enables the checking of building models against individual clauses within a building code, or alternatively, checking individual object types or group of objects rather than the entire building model. Once the checking is completed, the interactive reporting interface offers a variety of viewing options and enables the user to input the required specifications of objects. The first code to be implemented is the disabled access code.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest in the interoperability between building information models (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS). BIM can provide rich information for the generation of a GIS model, while the analysis tools in GIS can be used by BIM applications, such as the management of material supply chains and site selection. A comprehensive integration of the BIM and GIS is critical for interoperability between the two domains. However, many integration methods including manual inspection of complex and heterogeneous model files are time-consuming and have weak generalisation capability. This paper proposes a new linguistic-based semantic mapping method that uses the letter trigram-based word hashing method (WHSMM) to construct the feature vector, and then maps the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) schemas through text mining techniques at schema level. The semantic mapping precision and recall obtained using WHSMM are compared with those of another linguistic-based method. The mapping result shows that performance of WHSMM is superior to that of another method in most cases. Therefore, the mapping candidates of WHSMM are used to transform the IFC datasets into CityGML models. The transformation results show that most of mapping candidates of the WHSMM can be used to practical data integration. The semantic mapping method presented in this paper can help map the IFC and CityGML schemas by effectively reducing the search space of the manual mapping method.}

In order to enhance the sustainability of building, involved actors should be able to access and share not only information about the building but also data about products and especially their environmental assessment. Among several approaches that have been proposed to achieve that, semantic web technologies stand out from the crowd by their capabilities to share data and enhance interoperability in between the most heterogeneous systems. This paper presents the implementation of a method in which semantic web technologies and particularly Linked Data have been combined with Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools to foster building sustainability by introducing products with their environmental assessment in building data during the modelling phase. Based on Linked Building Data (LBD) vocabularies and environmental data, several ontologies have been generated in order to make both of them available as Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs. A database access plugin has been developed and installed in a BIM tool. In that way, the LBD generated from the BIM tool contains, for each product a reference to its environmental assessment which is contained in a triplestore.},

Semantic web technologies promise to reduce data interoperability issues. However, methods to discover occupants’ experiences and integrate those with linked building data are scarce. This paper aims to show how combining knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technology could lead to an improved understanding of occupants’ experiences in buildings. This approach is applied to a case study using the Open Family Home. An occupant collected feedback on various comfort indicators using a smartwatch app. Building information, sensor data, weather data, and occupant information and feedback were integrated into a cross-domain semantic digital twin. A Python script collected all the data from the digital twin and ran a data analysis, after which parameters that affected the occupant’s experience were collected. The results were transformed into triples and integrated with the linked building data. This combination of knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technologies results in enriched digital twins that can be used for occupant-centric decision-making. The approach presented in this study was generalized into a four-step method that can be applied at a variety of use-cases in the architecture, engineering, and construction domain.},

Especially for smart home developments, the integration of information about the building, users and Internet of Things (IoT) devices could be valuable. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the standard model for the semantic web, however, labeled property graphs (LPG) also proved to be effective in linking data. This research used the Open Smart Home Dataset and a dataset representing a kitchen to compare the two graph models both qualitatively and quantitatively. The comparison shows that native labeled property graphs are less complex and outperform the atomic RDF in complex graph traversals. However, RDF shows qualitative advantages for multi-domain and multi-stakeholder environments, such as the use of ontologies and HTTP URIs, making it a more stable interoperability format.},

However, models simulating the occupants’ perceived performance of indoor environments require highly heterogeneous input data. This paper aims to show how semantic web technologies can help to overcome problems deriving from this heterogeneity issue. Literature is studied to categorize the necessary input information for modeling occupants’ perceived building performance. Two perspectives were consulted, namely the Indoor Environmental Quality approach and the Healing Environments approach. Based on the results, a core IEQ data model, integrating building topology, static properties, and dynamic properties, is proposed. We introduced a method to integrate this information by using the Building Performance Ontology (BOP). This method was tested by manually transforming the Open Smart Home (OSH) data to BOP vocabulary. Time-series data from various sensors were stored in InfluxDB and connected to the linked building data. A custom-built python tool was created to compute the thermal comfort of the OSH using the PMV/PPD method. The results indicate that a com-mon data structure for static and dynamic properties helps to integrate the heter-ogeneity input data. Furthermore, we showed that adding occupants’ data or sys-tem information could improve thermal comfort through multiple reactive ap-proaches.},

A built asset is represented as a set of objects, each with an identity, attributes, and relations. This object-oriented nature enables new approaches for ensuring compliance with a range of requirements: e.g. industry guidelines; pro-ject and client-specific requirements; and building codes and standards. Furthermore, bottom-up design ap-proaches are known to be more suitable for quality control and design errors detection. Based on an adapted version of simulated annealing concept, this paper proposes an automated compliance checking classification and identifies a set of desired characteristics these methods should fulfil. It then demonstrates a bottom-up object-centred approach for automated model checking and the corresponding plugin prototype. The approach and the prototype enable four key processes and satisfy all desired characteristics of compliance checking methods including content validation, model completeness, smart object, and design option checking. To demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the approach, two case studies are processed using existing BIM objects libraries one of which is created by a major French manufacturer. All four steps were successfully completed, and the results show savings of around 125 minutes per object between the automated approach and traditional manual methods of working.},

  abstract = {Smart building applications such as security, energy management and caregiving require  information on occupant movements. Unlike cameras and mobile devices, sensing approaches for  occupant localization that are based on footstep-induced floor vibrations preserve the privacy of  indoor occupants. Current occupant-localization methodologies that rely on vibration measurements  are intended for single-occupant scenarios. In reality, multiple people walk regularly at the same  time. Resulting floor vibrations include a superposition of the structural responses from all occupants  walking simultaneously. Prior research into occupant localization using data-driven techniques  typically involves triangulation, and this requires densely instrumented floor slabs to determine the  difference between times of arrival of vibrations at sensor locations. Overlapping signals from  multiple occupants limit the applicability of such strategies. Furthermore, these techniques do not  account for the structural behavior of floor slabs, leading to ambiguous interpretations of vibration  measurements in the presence of obstructions and varying floor rigidities. In this paper, a model based data interpretation approach using error-domain model falsification (EDMF) is used to  localize multiple occupants. EDMF incorporates information related to physics-based models in the  interpretation of vibration measurements to identify a population of possible occupant locations.  EDMF has the potential to identify accurately two occupant locations by explicitly accommodating  systematic errors and model bias to reject models that contradict measurement data. Localization  results of each detected footstep are used to identify occupant trajectories. A full-scale case study,  instrumented with sparse sensor configuration (approximately one sensor per 75 m2 ), is used to  evaluate the utility of this methodology for multiple-occupant tracking. This data interpretation  approach is able to identify accurately and precisely two-occupant locations in a full-scale structure.},

OQuaRE has been applied to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different ontologies but, so far, this framework has not been evaluated itself. Therefore, in this paper we present the evaluation of OQuaRE, performed by an international panel of experts in ontology engineering.

  abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is regulated by a high number of rules given by laws, codes and standards, at national and international level. Much effort has been made to automate the checking of these rules, which is increasingly more efficient in terms of time and cost, such as the use of BIM tools. However, regulatory standards are written in human language. Wide and complex, they require substantial understanding and knowledge on the part of users. To allow the automation of the verification, it is first necessary a semantic analysis of the normative text, in order to adapt its meaning to a language that can be interpreted by computer software. This article demonstrates the application of the RASE methodology of semantic mark-up within the Brazilian accessibility standard, the configuration of Solibri Model Checker rules from these logical statements obtained and a simulation of these rules checking in a BIM model prepared for this purpose. The results were quantified for this paper and proved to be promising. They also identified the need for research to change the methodology of how the rules should be written so that they can be interpreted computationally},

  abstract = {Laser scanners provide a mostly geometric representation, but further details can be  collected by analysing the recording setup. While the recording configuration is needed in post processing, it is generally not passed on to the engineers as most scans are created by surveyors and  handled by subcontractors. This disconnection between the consumer and the creator can be  observed by the fact, that most laser scanned point clouds include intensity information. In day to  day use, the intensity information serves as a substitute for colour as it provides contrasts between  different objects in the recording. However, from the technical perspective the intensity is the result  of the recording device interacting with the surface. This interaction should not be used for  automation as different recording setups may result in different interactions and outcomes. Facing  this problem, we propose a mechanism to enrich terrestrial laser scans by recreating original scan  parameters and further converting the intensity to reflectivity - a sole property of the recorded  surface.},

The software programming for this can be done automatically or semi-automatically based on predefined procedures. Thisenables a person skilled in the AEC domain to develop applicable rules without support of programmers. Therules can be then be applied to the semantic content of a Building Information Model, typically in the IFC format.Whether it is possible to develop a valid and reliable system applicable to rule sources (laws, codes, regulationsand standards) depends on testing two key hypotheses:The user's perspective is basis for the first hypothesis which says that a pre-defined semantic system or toolset can be used by person skilled in the AEC domain (not software programmer) to define rules. The second hypothesis proposes that a system for automatic, or semi-automatic, generation of applicable rule sets for softwareimplementation can be developed},

We argue that a formal, systematic, logic-based approach to tackle qualitative performance goals and design requirements is not only valuable, but also necessary for enabling traceable, transparent code checking applications, and reducing laborious, error-prone manual processing. To this end we investigate a dedicated spatial reasoner, ASP4BIM, specifically designed for tackling implicit, uncertain, and fallible human knowledge about building-specific rules and constraints, such as objects’ functions and	structures, and	occupants’ experiences and behavior.

  abstract = {Query answering over Description Logic (DL) ontologies has become a vibrant field of research. Efficient realizations often exploit database technology and rewrite a given query to an equivalent SQL or Datalog query over a database associated with the ontology. This approach has been intensively studied for conjunctive query answering in the DL-Lite and EL families, but is much less explored for more expressive DLs and queries. We present a rewriting-based algorithm for conjunctive query answering over Horn-SHIQ ontologies, possibly extended with recursive rules under limited recursion as in DL+log. This setting not only subsumes both DL-Lite and EL, but also yields an algorithm for answering (limited) recursive queries over Horn-SHIQ ontologies (an undecidable problem for full recursive queries). A prototype implementation shows its potential for applications, as experiments exhibit efficient query answering over full Horn-SHIQ ontologies and benign downscaling to DL-Lite, where it is competitive with comparable state of the art systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract As Building Information Modeling evolves into becoming the central mean for coordinating project design and planning activities, we notice a few limitations/opportunities in the way current BIM tools address the needs for integrated design, collaboration and analysis (the initial objective of BIM). First, substantial communications and interactions about the design exist outside the BIM environment — typically in e-mail formats. This may cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste valuable knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need of engaging end-users and their keen interest in selecting “green” features. Professionals can develop different designs that achieve varying levels of energy conservation, but these will always require changes based on usage patterns. So, it is important that end-users are involved in the design process early on to make sure that they receive adequate information/ education before they make decisions. This is the nature of limitations that we try to address in this research. This paper builds around the design and development of an online system, named Green2.0 that tries to leverage advancements in Building Information Models (BIM), energy-efficiency simulation tools, and online social network analysis methods to enable a data-driven approach to building planning, construction and maintenance. Fundamentally, it allows participants (end-users or professionals) to comment and share views about building designs. Social network analysis and semantic modeling tools are then used to extract information from these interactions. At the same time, it connects BIM to energy analysis software to allow users to select different products from a catalog and assess the impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals, end-users and public policy makers work together throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an open platform, it provides access to information that enables researchers and practitioners to build new, more efficient theories and methods of building design. The premise of our work is that by providing new insights into the building design process it is likely to have a profound beneficial effect for both AEC professionals and the society at large.},

At the core of any ontology is an ontological model—an architecture of how the world (in a domain) behaves (or becomes). The ontology categorizes construction knowledge across three main dimensions: concept, modality, and context. Concept encompasses five key terms: entity (further subdivided into generic and secondary), environmental element, abstract concept, attribute, and system (combinations of the previous four types). Modality is a means for generating a variety of types for each of the described concepts. Context allows for linking concepts in a variety of ways—creating different worlds.},

Handling and processing the exchanged data remain a major challenge for many related activities, such as Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS). In this context, the interoperability between Building Information Models (BIM) and BEPS models is still an unresolved issue. Many barriers prevent the full integration and data exchange between both models, such as geometry errors and missing data, which require a lot of human intervention. Thus, the process is still regarded as time, effort and cost consuming. In the literature, many works have been done to tackle this problem. In this paper, in the context of the BIM4Ren European H2020 project, which aims at providing BIMbased tools and technologies for fast and efficient renovation of residential buildings, a systematic workflow is proposed to handle the BIM to BEPS process and review the commonly adopted tools and approaches for each of its stages, i.e., from the generation of the BIM model, its geometry check, its data enrichment until its exploitation by a BEPS tools. The proposed workflow is based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as an information exchange standard for the BIM since it is an open data schema that is commonly used and compatible with most of the BIM software in the market. Finally, a practical approach to follow for a smooth and effective model transfer process is concluded.},

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least 50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.},

As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by modular disciplinary ontolo-gies, can provide a solid ground to share and exchange data flexibly.},

Interoperability problems between different software often hinder disciplinary data integration, which prevents the recognition of violated design constraints until it is too late. The open-source platform Building Habitat object Model (BHoM) integrates many AEC concepts across existing languages and platforms, allowing multiple discrete disciplinary representations of buildings. The Linked Building Data Community Group of the World Wide Web Consortium uses Semantic Web standards to store and share data. This paper explores and presents methods to recast BHoM's object model as a knowledge graph using Semantic Web standards. It analyzes BHoM in an ontological context by elaborating on its approach to object-oriented programming and comparing it to the Semantic Web standards. Furthermore, it presents BHoM RDF prototypes as a potential solution to the interoperability problem of multidisciplinary design in AEC. It also exemplifies these BHoM RDF prototypes on a small demonstrator project. When combined with Semantic Web standards, the BHoM framework can increase the use of knowledge graphs in the AEC industry, improving data interoperability and assisting design decisions through reasoning.},

  abstract = {Most of the construction practices in the field of risk identification focus on the expertise, views, and judgments of subject matter experts. While the conventional expert-based approaches provide worth, several challenges exist due to time-consuming and expensive aspects. Moreover, limited experience in major projects makes public agencies susceptible to subjective judgment biases. To address these limitations, this study introduced a data-driven framework for risk identification using historical data and artificial intelligence techniques, particularly word embedding models. The model matches various risk items in past projects by considering the semantic meaning of words to find high frequency and consequence risks. Risk registers from more than 70 U.S. major transportation projects form the input dataset. The model is tested with more than 66\% recall and 0.59 F1-score for risk detection for new projects. Acquired knowledge from previous projects assists project teams and public agencies to be well-equipped with a risk identification model instead of starting from scratch.}

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling is a topic widely discussed in construction research today. It is a concept that potentially could benefit the construction industry in several different ways. Many believe that BIM will revolutionize the industry in the future. The buildingSMART data dictionary (bsDD) is an international standard developed by the neutral organization buildingSMART. It is a standard that defines the terminology surrounding BIM objects. Much research has been done on the potential benefits of BIM in general. However, no research has been made on the immediate consequences of an implementation of the buildingSMART data dictionary. The purpose of this thesis is to determine how a property development and construction company, that already works with BIM in many of its projects, would be affected by an implementation of the bsDD. The possible consequences of bsDD implementation are mapped out and analyzed through a literature review. In addition to this, a simulation is conducted with the purpose of showing how object libraries can be created on an organizational level. The findings of this thesis show that the consequences of a bsDD implementation can be summarized into three categories; technological, operational, and contractual consequences. The main consequences of the implementation would be that the employees would have to be provided education and continual support, through guidelines and internal BIM standards etc. The consequence with the largest impact, however, would be the task of creating an object library. This task is required since the bsDD does not have any Swedish content yet.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a proposal for a national building standard in Sweden. We define requirements for the proposed standard, e.g., it should support development of 3D city models, connect to building information models (BIM) and national registers and be based on a national classification system for the urban environment. Based on these requirements we develop an Application Domain Extension (ADE) of the building model in the proposed CityGML 3.0 standard denoted CityGML Sve-Test. CityGML 3.0 includes several new features of interest, e.g., the space concept, enhanced possibilities to convert data, and to link to other standards. In our study we create test data according to CityGML Sve-Test and evaluate it against the requirements. It is shown that BIM models (in Industry Foundation Classes, IFC, format) can be converted to CityGML Sve-Test and that a classification system facilitates this conversion. The CityGML Sve-Test dataset can be used to increase the automation level in building permissions checking and a related study shows that CityGML 3.0 has capabilities to link to legal information and be a base for 3D cadastral index maps. Based on our experience, we suggest that the national building standard should conform to international standards and, if possible, include a classification system. The exchange format (GML, JSON etc.) might change, but to be based on a standardized data model ensures harmonized structures and concepts.},

However, research shows that HVAC systems only ensure occupants satisfaction in the 11\% of the commercial buildings. The advancing spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the maturity of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) may contribute to develop accurate predictive models which address this challenge. But data analysts in charge of developing these predictive models may feel overwhelmed if they have insufficient domain expertise. In this article, the ontology-driven approach proposed by the EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) is presented, in which data analysts can benefit from previously captured domain knowledge to get support regarding which are the variables to consider when developing a model which accurately predicts the thermal comfort within buildings. Compared with the existing tools or methods, the EEPSA is able to suggest variables that may not necessarily be included in the set of data available. This fact has a big potential nowadays, where the Linked Open Data and the third-party repositories are valuable sources of knowledge which can be exploited to incorporate relevant information to the set of data available.},

  abstract = {The application of suitable data structures is an essential aspect for novel digital workflows in engineering and design processes of the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Since model-based data exchange gets increasingly adopted by the industry, feasible and more effective methods must be considered to improve data exchange in the future. While the concept of federated model integration and container-based collaboration as demanded by ISO19650 is well established and widely adopted, it shows a number of deficiencies, in particular when it comes to consistency preservation across the domain models and the handling of design updates. Current practice relies on the exchange of complete domain models which requires the manual identification of design changes by all other stakeholders. Consistency is checked merely by collision detection, which however can cover only geometric aspects. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a comprehensive system architecture as well as techniques to identify updates in models and federate such update information by means of update patches. To this end, specific focus is put on possible mechanisms to detect changes and to integrate update patches in the receiving application.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers the potential to transform our lives in radical ways. However, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even underestimate what various technologies in AI are capable of today. Certainly, the translation from scientific papers and benchmark performance to products is faster in AI than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is often the case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. This document describes an example-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (e.g., maturity and availability levels). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI and identify different categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness-vs-generality charts, where we see that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while low TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields, and show their readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as a base for a broader discussion of AI technologies. Finally, we use the dynamics of several AI technology at different generality levels and moments of time to forecast some short-term and mid-term trends for AI.},

In this paper, we discuss that bounding box technique cannot help precise identification of IFC objects and does not fulfill all our requirements of code compliance checking. Therefore, we have to go beyond bounding boxes and analyze Well-known Text format for the precise identification of data objects in the building model. Well-Known Text is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map and offers a precise and compact machine and human-readable representation of geometric objects. We explored two geospatial tools (Stardog and GraphDB) for working with Well-known Text and illustrate various examples narrating their similarities and differences on various test cases. Both the tools implement several extensions to ease queries for processing geospatial data. These Geo-SPARQL extentions are designed to accommodate systems based on qualitative spatial reasoning and systems based on quantitative spatial computations.},

Indeed these are great efforts, but, still there is a gap for the fully automatic building code-compliance. This paper presents our research and development of Semantic BIM Reasoner (SBIM-Reasoner) which employs semantic technologies to meet the requirements of semantic verification of an IFC model. SBIM-Reasoner employs several preprocessors (IFC to RDF converter, Geometry Extractor) to build the semantic repository from the input IFC model. Once all the triples are generated from the initial data (.ifc file), Stardog is used to build a knowledge graph for the semantic verification. All types of inference and reasoning mechanisms for the semantic verification are applied over this knowledge graph to meet the requirements of verification. Knowledge graph over triplets enables freedom of extending RDF based Semantic IFC model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation of newer rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with condition and constraints over IFC data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the initial data of IFC model, etc. Finally, we tested our prototype by using several online IFC models. We conclude that semantic technologies provide more rich mechanisms and answer vast types of queries for the verification of IFC models. It provides powerful features based on SPARQL libraries and serves best for the automated code compliance and verification of IFC models.},

The traditional approach is by using IfcDoc tool developed by buildingSMART International to improve the consistent and computer-interpretable definition of Model View Definitions. On the other hand, Semantic Web technologies, especially Semantic Web rule language, allow the semantic validation of IFC models to enable the compliance checking of IFC construction models with unmatchable query performance and flexibility. Therefore, we present and compare IfcDoc and Semantic Web rule language technologies for the model instance verification and conformance checking of IFC models, and demonstrate various important aspects and their limitations. We conclude that both technologies have their specific significances, but Semantic Web technologies provide a better hand over the traditional approach. The Semantic Web approach with the goal of combining the strengths of an ontology and IFC technologies makes information retrieval from an IFC model faster, flexible and also enables interoperability between IFC documents.},

  abstract = {A building's strategic asset management (SAM) capability has traditionally been limited by its site-based management. With the emergence of needs from clients about delivering a long-term portfolio-based building asset management plan that minimizes the asset risk and optimizes the value of their asset portfolios, SAM Units have emerged as a new business form to provide various SAM services to their clients. However, the quality of their current data model is still hindered by many issues, such as missing important attributes and the lack of customized information flow guidance. In addition, there is a gap in integrating their existing data collection with various data sources and Building Information Modeling (BIM) to enhance their data quality. By evaluating a SAM Unit's portfolio case study, this paper identifies the factors limiting the quality of SAM Units' data model and develops a guide to integrating various data sources better. We develop a BIM-integrated portfolio-based SAM information flow framework and a detailed hierarchical portfolio-based non-geometric data structure.

Massive amounts of BIM researches have been published in academic journals, books and conference proceedings. However, more than half of the published researches are not cited, and some researches with similar questions and outputs are published. In this research, the Linked Data paradigm is utilized with ontologies to provide a structured database of the different articles of BIM and mapped to different BIM aspects in a semantically meaningful format. The proposed ontologies and Linked Data can accelerate and enhance systematic reviews and metadata analysis for future BIM studies. Also, it can assist young researchers to define the gaps that need to be filled in BIM studies and avoid repetitive researches.},

BIM-AM data integration has come with issues related to establishing an effective process to extract, store, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Several information exchange specifications such as COBie and SPARKie have been developed to enable effective interoperability for better building assets operation and maintenance. Due to asset heterogeneity, the exchange models cannot be generalised and applied to all assets systems. Exchange models need to be developed for particular asset systems based on their functionality and building type. In order to contribute to overcoming the BIM-AM interoperability challenge, this study aims to provide the required semantic and syntactic interoperability aspects for the data exchange of assets that consume energy from the BIM systems to the AM systems during the handover stage.},

  abstract = {At present, the capability to collect information from different sources [building information modeling (BIM), sensors, assets database] for asset management (AM) use has generated significant opportunities for asset owners and facility managers. BIM, in particular, is considered as a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data integration in a BIM environment has issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the AM processes. This research explored the asset owner requirements from BIM in the operation and maintenance stage from an AM perspective. The research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the nongeometric BIM data required for AM and develop a relevant taxonomy; and second, to develop an application programming interface (API) plug-in for Autodesk Revit to implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of this study, a critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and focus group interviews with BIM and facilities management (FM) experts were conducted. The main output was a 60-parameter asset-consuming energy information management (ACE-IM) taxonomy and the relevant API plug-in that can help BIM professionals to identify the required data to be submitted to facility managers to improve AM processes.},

To do so, we consider an ifcOWL ontology proposed by buildingSMART. The ifcOWL is an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) based ontology. By combining the ifcOWL ontology with logical rules (expressed in Semantic Web Rule Language, SWRL), we demonstrate through several case studies that our approach can perform a more intuitive and flexible extraction of building views when compared to the Model View Definition (MVD) approach. This is because our rule-based approach dynamically creates sub-graphs (i.e. views) by specifying the IFC elements to extract as Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID), relationships or entities. Another benefit of our approach is the fact that it simplifies the maintenance and definition of building views. Once our rule-based system extracts such a building view (i.e. sub-graph), this view can be exported by using STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product) or Turtle (a Resource Description Framework (RDF) syntax) formats.},

Go-ing beyond the geometric representation of a building, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an approach that aims at integrating into one single system heterogeneous data and processes from different actors. Such integration is a complex and fastidious task. The implementation of the related processes for data querying, retrieval or modification is not less difficult. To tackle this prob-lem, we have developed a novel approach based on Semantic Web technolo-gies. In doing so, we have defined an ontology inspired on IFC standard for rep-resenting building information. On top of this ontology, we have defined and implemented a set of SWRL rules. The paper at hand describes these rules and their application in the context of building information handling (notably by means of IFC files)},

  abstract = {Ontologies are becoming increasingly important in large-scale information systems such as healthcare systems. Ontologies can represent knowledge from clinical guidelines, standards, and practices used in the healthcare sector and may be used to drive decision support systems for healthcare, as well as store data (facts) about patients. Real-life ontologies may get very large (with millions of facts or instances). The effective use of ontologies requires not only a well-designed and well-defined ontology language, but also adequate support from reasoning tools. Main memory-based reasoners are not suitable for reasoning over large ontologies due to the high time and space complexity of their reasoning algorithms. In this paper, we present OwlOntDB, a scalable reasoning system for OWL 2 RL ontologies with a large number of instances, i.e., large ABoxes. We use a logic-based approach to develop the reasoning system by extending the Description Logic Programs (DLP) mapping between OWL 1 ontologies and datalog rules, to accommodate the new features of OWL 2 RL. We first use a standard DL reasoner to create a complete class hierarchy from an OWL 2 RL ontology, and translate each axiom and fact from the ontology to its equivalent datalog rule(s) using the extended DLP mapping. We materialize the ontology to infer implicit knowledge using a novel database-driven forward chaining method, storing asserted and inferred knowledge in a relational database. We evaluate queries using a modified SPARQL-DL API over the relational database. We show our system performs favourably with respect to query evaluation when compared to two main-memory based reasoners on several ontologies with large datasets including a healthcare ontology.},

Building permit processes differ even within the authorities of a state or a country and have been mostly developed traditionally. A decision model is proposed as a decision-supporting instrument which shows the authorities’ reviewer possibilities and alternatives of actions during a building permit review. This procedure aims at more transparency and objectivity. The proposed approach provides a starting point for implementing and using BIM.

Deep learning-based structural design methods enable machines to acquire expert experiences, but domain knowledge (e.g., empirical laws summarized by engineers from engineering practices) has not been embedded into such data-driven methods, resulting in common sense-conflicting designs. A knowledge-enhanced generative adversarial network is proposed by incorporating a novel differentiable evaluator for compliance checking of domain knowledge. A comparative study indicates that the proposed knowledge-enhanced method is 51\% superior to the conventional data-driven method and 150 times faster than a competent engineer. The proposed method facilitates the schematic design of framed tube structures to be automatic and efficient, hence improving the productivity of structural engineers.}

With the rapidly-expanding indoor positioning technologies that support public safety operations, a more efficient and effective building information platform is needed to support indoor location data visualization and coordination efforts. On the other hand, building information modeling (BIM) has been widely accepted in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry as a central repository of building information. BIM does not only include accurate geometric building data and sufficient semantic information but also could be integrated with real-time smart building data. The ultimate goal of this research effort is to bridge the technology gap between various emerging indoor positioning technologies and abundant building information and thus to overcome the main shortcoming of the existing indoor building model. A BIM-based Indoor Location (BIMIL) portal is designed in this work for automatic data extraction, visualization, and transformation of BIM emergency-related data for public safety purposes. Subsequently, the new generalized building 3D model can be overlaid with indoor positioning data to support emergency responses.}

Energy retrofitting offers meaningful and tangible benefits beyond energy cost saving, such as the reduction of C02 emissions and demolition wastes or others which give added value to the building such as comfort for its inhabitants.On the other hand, the common complexity and low cost-efficiency of the renovation process make often the retrofitting unaffordable.

All these drawbacks hinder the growth of this sector, which requires a comprehensive understanding to undertake the transformation of the sector.In  parallel,  the  BIM  approach  has  proven  its  ability  to  provide  a  reliable  and  rich  enough  model  to perform  several  realistic  simulations  of  a  construction  project  since  the  design  phase  in  order  to support decision making processes.

  abstract = {Current PLM or BIM based information systems suffer from a lack of checking components for business rules. One reason is the misunderstanding of the role and nature of business rules, and how they should be treated in a product-centric information system. This paper intends to provide both a process and a related model to build such a component and enrich future systems. Rules and requirements process management enables the unambiguous formalization of implicit knowledge contained in business rules, generally expressed in easily understandable language, and leads to the formal expression of requirements. In this paper, the requirements are considered a consequence of the application of a business rule. A conceptual model is then introduced, called DALTON (DAta Linked Through Occurrences Network), which supports this process. In this ontology, concepts and product data, coming for instance from an existing product database, are represented using instances and occurrences, connected together with triples built from business rules and requirements according to previous management processes. An experiment involving a set of SWRL rules is conducted in the Protégé environment that validates the model and the process.},

But the increase of constrains surrounding information management in an industrial context, and notably for power plant design, like the increase of data, actors, systems and the need of automation and collaboration leads to an increasing use of ontology-based models. However, the design of power plants presents a specific issue, which is rules expression and validation. This need of rules is generated by safety, interoperability or collaboration constrains. The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is an ontological language based on OWL-DL that allows in addition rules expression. This paper presents SWRL rules and their industrial applications but also limits of this language in PLM applications. It proposes in consequence other rules languages.},

  abstract = {Building codes enforce minimum quality level for buildings to ensure the safety of building occupants. Automated compliance checking can guarantee the consistent application of all relevant building codes to a building model. Although automated compliance checking has received considerable research interest, there are no tools available that can automate the entire compliance checking process. Since most countries' building regulations are only available in natural language, much research effort flows into encoding these regulations in a representation that can be understood by a computer. Current deep learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can achieve a comprehensive understanding of a text and constitute a promising solution for the automated computerisation of building regulations. This systematic literature review assesses the state-of-the-art of NLP for building code interpretation by analysing 42 research articles published since 2000. These were selected from 1,962 records retrieved from six databases, plus further candidate articles detected by backwards snowballing and author search strategies. The studies used NLP to process regulatory documents, analyse text and extract syntactic and semantic features, filter out irrelevant clauses using text classification, and extract the information required to transform the regulation into a computer-processable format. Semantic alignment of the regulation concepts and the building design information fills the gap to automated reasoning. The information extraction task received the highest research interest. The approaches are highly variant in the depth of extracted information and the complexity of the regulations. Rule-and ontology-based approaches were commonly used and reached high performance but are highly task-specific and difficult to scale. Although state-of-the-art machine learning techniques showed the potential to provide a scalable solution, there is still room for improvement. Overall, eight research gaps were identified in the current literature. Information extraction and information alignment were the most complex and challenging tasks, where methods that are both scalable and high-performing are still missing. Also, most studies were limited to quantitative requirements. For a full digital version of building regulations, entire regulatory documents with all expressions of requirements (e.g. textual, tabular and figure encoded) need to be translated, and high quality needs to be assured.},

We investigate how semantic web technology can support BIM-based automated cost estimation and what challenges that can appear. Standardized specifications of work for Norwegian road projects (with process codes and process descriptions) were linked to an IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) property set by semantic web technology. Future projects that use the standardized specifications of work can adopt the established setup and thereby automate cost estimation with minimal efforts. This practical approach will accelerate the application of semantic web technology in the AEC industry to automate services.},

To that end, we introduce Architext, a novel semantic generation assistive tool. Architext enables design generation with only natural language prompts, given to large-scale Language Models, as input. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation of Architext's downstream task performance, focusing on semantic accuracy and diversity for a number of pre-trained language models ranging from 120 million to 6 billion parameters. Architext models are able to learn the specific design task, generating valid residential layouts at a near 100\% rate. Accuracy shows great improvement when scaling the models, with the largest model (GPT-J) yielding impressive accuracy ranging between 25\% to over 80\% for different prompt categories. We open source the finetuned Architext models and our synthetic dataset, hoping to inspire experimentation in this exciting area of design research.},

  abstract = {As volumetric modular construction is gaining attention worldwide, there is a growing interest in the representation and model-based data exchange for modular buildings to optimise and communicate the design generation to prefabrication. This paper presents a Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based graph data model for the theoretic representation of essential characteristics in modular buildings, intending to automate and optimise the generative design for modular construction. The proposed new method involves the establishment of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) model view definition (MVD) to comprehensively describe the required information for designing modular buildings. Following this, the IFC MVD is mapped to a graph data model, which includes the explicit formulation of absent spatial attributes, topological relationships, geometries, and semantics for volumetric modules. In compliance with the graph-theoretic representation, data transformation algorithms are developed to convert the required information in BIM to the graph model for assorted information query. Provided the extracted information, a prototype system is developed and examined via an illustrative example focusing on the automatic generative design of modular buildings.}

This work proposes an efficient framework for a bridge DT with decreased communication complexity to achieve updates synchronously and provide feedback to the physical bridge in time. The integrated edge computing and non-cellular long-distance wireless communication enable DT resilience when cloud servers become unresponsive due to the loss of internet connection. This framework is validated by different scenarios for DTs in support of bridge inspection and monitoring. It is demonstrated that the framework can enable dynamic interaction between on-site inspection and online bridge DT during the survey as well as knowledge transfer among different sectors in time. It can also support local decision-making on a single bridge as well as regional dynamic coordination for multiple bridges without cloud-server involvement.},

As a result, this also increases the difficulty for quickly finding useful BIM resources that are sufficiently close to user's specific needs. Keyword-based search methods have been widely used due to their ease of use, but their search accuracy is often not satisfactory because of the semantic ambiguity of terminologies in BIM-specific documents and queries. To address this issue, we develop a prototype semantic search engine, named BIMSeek, for retrieving online BIM resources. The central work consists of two parts as follows. Firstly, based on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which is a major standard for BIM, a domain ontology is constructed for encoding BIM-specific knowledge into the search engine. Using the ontology, term`inologies in BIM documents can be disambiguated and indexed. Secondly, by combining the ontology and local context analysis technique, an automatic query expansion method is presented for improving retrieval performance. Compared with traditional keyword-based methods and WordNet-based query expansion methods, the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms them. The search engine is available at http://cgcad.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/liuyushen/ifcqe/.},

However, conventional operation and maintenance processes are limited with a high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections and the lack of real-time input of dynamic factors. In this regard, engagement of an Integrated Knowledge-based Building Management System using nD BIM applications (nD BIM-IKBMS) is anticipated to promote promising resolutions. The proposed system is expected to provide simulation-based supervisory control while automatically detecting and diagnosing operational faults. Following the literature-based conceptual model developed in our past research, this study aims to generate and verify the proposed framework theoretically, as the second step of nD BIM-IKBMS research and development series, concentrating on functional modeling. Notwithstanding which, it is difficult to describe a cross-disciplinary system following a single framework. As the technology evolves, the framework can not be generalized into new scenarios. Towards this end, the study is followed through the complexity theory lens. A highly flexible framework, considering that each part wherein has an opportunity to evolve, was developed. Following the principles of axiomatic design, the proposed framework was established. Ultimately, this research generates a range of detailed 3-hierarchical Icam DEFinitions for Function Modeling 0 (IDEF0) diagrams outlining the proposed nD BIM-IKBMS structure. This study identifies the interoperability of the proposed framework by standardizing communication protocols, data formats, naming convention, evaluation systems, and modulization. While this research is limited to implementing our nD BIM-IKBMS framework, real-world projects will be utilized in our upcoming steps of R\&D series for validation purposes.},

To ameliorate these knowledge and practice gaps, this study provides a new coupled generative adversarial network (CoGAN)-based framework for automated modular housing design generation. Furthermore, this approach encompasses a new module configuration algorithm that structurally modularize a generated housing design layout. This framework is expected to contribute to establishing the body of knowledge in a generative design of modular housing for mass building production and help architects and relevant stakeholders facilitate their design processes by yielding feasible, constructible, and optimal modular housing design alternatives.}

The data types of two main domains of building information modeling and building management system have been considered in the majority of existing ontologies. Three main applications are evident from a critical analysis of existing ontologies: (1) key performance indicator calculation, (2) building performance improvement, and (3) fault detection and diagnosis. The key gaps found in the literature review are a holistic ontology for SOCx and insight on how such approaches should be evaluated. Based on these findings, this study provides recommendations for future necessary research including: identification of SOCx-related data types, assessment of ontology performance, and creation of open-source approaches.},

  abstract = {The building sector consumes about 40\% of global energy, which is largely caused by buildings’ operations. Research showed that providing users with detailed consumption and appliance-usage data may engage them in energy efficiency activities. To do so, data analytic services must be deployed by third parties. These services require a huge amount of data from the users in order to offer high quality services. Nevertheless, users are usually reluctant to share their data especially if its private. This is the case of those measurements performed inside the buildings, as they may be an indicative of the occupants’ behaviour. In these scenarios, data sovereignty plays a key role because it provides to data owners a way to define data usage requirements and verify their compliance in a trustworthy way. In consequence, the owners’ predisposition to exchange their data is expected to increase. This article takes a step forward in the development of a trustworthy ecosystem for the built environment where data sovereignty is provided. Specifically, an approach is proposed to formally specify data usage requirements for the built environment based on ontologies. Furthermore, this approach has been implemented in a real world home use case. Keywords: Buildings · Ontology · Distributed Data Usage Control · Policy Specification},

Thus, an extensive data model is created that enables the representation of infrastructure and maintenance-related facts in Linked Data and is compatible with the German standards and guidelines. The national standard "ASB-ING" contains about 120 classes and 500 attributes to describe a bridge or tunnel and its damages. It is the basis for the relational database program "SIB-Bauwerke", in which most bridges in Germany are recorded over the last 20 years. By converting the ASB-ING model into an Ontology, compatibility with this extensive available data set is ensured, enabling a direct translation of the existing asset data into Linked Data models. Concurrently, it is possible to relate the classes of this national data model with classes of other national or international ontologies. By mapping the ASB-ING Ontology to ifcOWL, the formerly only tabular data can be linked to standardised geometry models without requiring additionally developed geometric representation. Interlinking the ASB-ING Ontology with other international and national infrastructure data models can improve asset information exchange of cross-border projects.},

Open standards, such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), have contributed to expand its adoption, but they have limited capabilities for cross-domain information integration and query. To address these challenges, the Linked Building Data initiative promotes the use of ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in order to create more formal and interoperable BIMs. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based extension of such semantic BIMs that provides support for imprecise knowledge representation and retrieval. We propose an expressive fuzzy ontology language, and describe how to use a fuzzy reasoning engine in a BIM context with selected examples. The resulting fuzzy semantic BIM enables new functionalities in the project design and analysis stages—namely, soft integration of cross-domain knowledge, flexible BIM query, and imprecise parametric modeling.},

A good combination of these systems and tools is beneficial for a better coordination and information management. Semantic web technologies and a Linked Data approach can be used to fulfil this aim. In this paper, we indicate how these technologies can be applied for one particular objective, namely to check a building information model (BIM) and make suggestions for that model regarding the building elements. These suggestions are based on information obtained from different data sources, including a BIM model, regulations and catalogues of locally available building components. In this paper, we briefly discuss the results obtained in the application of this approach in a case study based on structural safety requirements.},

Among the measures to strength buildings information is the Digital Building Logbook; the common repository for all relevant data. Fire risk data is, as seen, part of this relevant data. In order to produce outcomes at this level, the fire risk methodologies rely on other types of building data that must be also supported by the above-mentioned tools. The contributions in this paper rely on the disclosure of the minimum requirements in terms of data to perform massive Fire Risk (FR) analysis at city scale, as well as the required data to perform more complex analysis, based on the building logbooks. By doing it the outcomes contribute to the safety of buildings, namely in terms of fire risk, to strength the buildings information strategies, to improved renovation processes and to increase the resilience of cities.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an indoor navigation support system based on the Building Information Models (BIM) paradigm. Although BIM is initially defined for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction/Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry, the authors believe that it can provide added value in this context. To this end, the authors will focus on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard for the formal representation of BIM. The approach followed in this paper will be based on the ifcOWL ontology, which translates the IFC schemas into Ontology Web Language (OWL). Several modifications of this ontology have been proposed, consisting of the inclusion of new items, SWRL rules and SQWRL searches. This way of expressing the elements of a building can be used to code information that is very useful for navigation, such as the location of elements related to the actions desired by the user. It is important to note that this design is intended to be used as a complement to other well-known tools and techniques for indoor navigation. The proposed modifications have been successfully tested in a variety of simulated and real scenarios. The main limitation of the proposal is the immense amount of information contained in the ifcOWL ontology, which causes difficulties involving its processing and the time necessary to perform operations on it. Those elements that are considered important have been selected, removing those that seem secondary to navigation. This procedure will result in a significant reduction in the storage and semantic processing of the information. Thus, for a system with 1000 individuals (in the ontological sense), the processing time is about 90~s. The authors regard this time as acceptable, since in most cases the tasks involved can be considered part of the system initialization, meaning they will only be executed once at the beginning of the process.},

This article sheds light on the current construction processes from a different perspective through the analysis of three study cases. Until now, building projects were mainly analyzed through their plans and geometry. We suggest that BIM projects should also be studied through the analysis of the information stored in the “digital twin” of the building. We consider a digital twin as a database linked to the building’s digital geometry. We make the hypothesis that the study of this database and the way in which the actor’s structure and manage this information, will give a better insight on how functions these buildings.},

In this paper, we present an ontological system, which relies on integrating the as-is information BIM and semantic web technology. The developed approach improves existing building facilities, as-is information formalization, and management for maintenance purposes. The paper outcome is a semantically integrated knowledge-based framework that can potentially: 1) constitute a semantic database for building facilities components as-is information using BIM; 2) overcome the lack and absence of retrieving and reusing building facilities as-is domain information; and (3) formalize the building facilities as-is knowledge in a computable way.},

  abstract = {A smart built environment has become necessary for ensuring social well-being due to uncontrolled population growth and unrestrainable urban sprawl. In this connection, effective land administration is a significant element to actualize sustainable development. Yet existing building permit procedures fail to satisfy the need for current construction demands because of the insufficient transparency and inefficient procedures. Two dimensional (2D) based systems also remain incapable to unambiguously delineate the property ownership related to complex buildings. Keeping up-to-date the three dimensional (3D) urban models is another key for smart cities but this issue has become difficult owing to the rapid changes in the cities. In this sense, this paper first examines thoroughly the current situation in Turkey in terms of the building permit procedures, land administration, and 3D city modeling. Then, the paper detailedly proposes a reformative framework. The framework consists of the use of digital building models for both building permit processes and 3D registration of property ownership, as well as updating the 3D city model databases. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of its applicability with a discussion of the prospective directions.},

This rate of prefabrication is the highest in the world and the manufacturing of timber-frame homes has become a modern sector of the economy in Sweden. Information, and communication technology (ICT) has long played a key role in industrializing the wood-based building industry and novel ICT, like augmented reality, are believed to provide new opportunities. It is in this context that we explore how artificial reality solutions can be applied to improve the quality assurance process in a company producing prefabricated homes in Småland, Sweden. The research question asked in this study is: How can augmented reality be successfully applied to support quality assurance practice in the wood-based building industry? This question warrants investigation since improving quality assurance in house manufacturing not only improves products but also increases customer satisfaction. To investigate this question, we conduct a case study in a company where we set up a quasi-experiment with five quality assurance professionals using Microsoftǯs HoloLens displaying production data. To make sense of their experiences, we conducted a series of semi-structured de-briefing interviews. Moreover, for understanding how AR can be successfully deployed in quality assurance we apply the design science research method. Findings are that the success of using AR in quality assurance depends on the quality of information displayed on the system, the geolocation of the models, the quality of the software and hardware used, and the ruggedness of the devices. We claim to have provided a range of valuable practical and theoretical contributions transferable to other construction companies seeking to apply augmented reality in their quality assurance routines.},

Overlapping these domains will combine their individual fea-tures and provide support to important activities such as building emergency re-sponse, construction site safety, construction supply chain management, and sus-tainable urban design. Interoperability through open data standards is one method of connecting software tools from BIM and GIS domains. However, no single open data standard available today can support all information from the two do-mains. As a result, many researchers have been working to overlap or connect different open data standards to enhance interoperability. An overview of these studies will help identify the different approaches used and determine the ap-proach with the most potential to enhance interoperability. This paper adopted a strong definition of interoperability using information technology (IT) based standard documents. Based on this definition, previous approaches towards im-proving interoperability between BIM and GIS applications through open data standards were studied. The result shows previous approaches have implemented data conversion, data integration, and linked data approaches. Between these methods, linked data emerged as having the most potential to connect open data standards and expand interoperability between BIM and GIS applications be-cause it allows information exchange without editing the original data. The paper also identifies the main challenges in implementing linked data technologies for interoperability and provides directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Data from building automation and control systems are becoming more and more important, since they are used in a growing number of (novel and established) analytics applications such as fault detection \&amp; diagnostics (FDD), smart maintenance and optimization. However, the quality of such data is often poor due to erroneous installation, commissioning, data recording or meta-information. In addition, building automation engineering and service departments usually focus on implementing and maintaining basic control functionality – data acquisition, tagging quality, and analytics do often not take priority. Due to these data quality issues, a first important step in any data analytics operation is to ensure data integrity. One main goal of data integrity checks is to increase data reliability. The paper presents such checks for building automation applications, in particular three different types of plausibility checks for time series data: single signal tests, similarity tests, and reaction tests. Examples using data recorded from real building automation project are presented for each of the three check types, demonstrating the usefulness of these checks. Data integrity checks are set up and configured using the available metadata which – in our case – comes in the form of semantic models that are automatically generated from building automation engineering data. Many data integrity checks have been identified that are potentially of great benefit in practice – both as a stand-alone application or as first part in a data analytics process. The major prerequisite for successful data integrity checking is that the checks can be set up with minimal effort and executed periodically. To achieve a high degree of automation, semantic data is of great importance, because it is through them that the recorded time series are provided with context and meaning. The automatically generated semantic models from building automation engineering proved to be already rich in automation information and are sufficient for many of the checks investigated.},

  abstract = {Currently, utilizing digital representations of bridge constructions is still limited to geometry-based models with none or only little semantic data. Consequently, assessing these models requires the interpretation of external sources, e.g. relational databases or reports. Despite new approaches in the Building Information Modeling (BIM) domain such as the IFC-Bridge extension for the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) try to provide models where geometric and semantic data are combined, a great proportion of information from current and future domains that are relevant for the bridge industry are not covered. For this reason, an extensible web ontology inspired from the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) for buildings has been developed, which functions as a core ontology for bridge representations and therefore covers all necessary general information used in this domain. The developed core ontology is interlinked with multiple domain specific bridge extensions in a bridge ontology framework that is applied on a test scenario. In this paper, the components of the bridge ontology framework are explained as well as the application on the test case. In addition, ontology alignments for BOT and ifcOWL are proposed as well as shapes for ontology validation. Furthermore, the functionality of a developed software prototype is described that generates the bridge ontology from a given IFC model.

Besides the topology, classes and properties for documentation management and a minimal structural assessment have been proposed in DOT. In this regard, DOT provides all classes and properties needed for practical use in construction inspections and damage assessment. The ontology is developed to be used with the modular Linked Building Data ontologies structure, where DOT works as core damage ontology which can be extended with multiple modules related to detailed damage classification, damage assessment, mechanical degradation and other application scenarios. Geometrical damage representations are separated from the topology, so that it is possible to initially record damages during the inspection without any geometrical properties and link it later with a corresponding representation using terminology from geometry-related ontologies. In conclusion, DOT can be applied as a stand-alone web ontology to represent damages in a machine-interpretable format and replace conventional record approaches. Therefore, a generic terminology is used that enables the inclusion of various types of damage, which can be extended with domain-specific information.},

Intelligent and systematic energy management technologies have been increasingly exploited to reduce the energy use in the building sector. Previous studies used their own decision model including knowledge-bases and rules. However, they are lack of a structural framework for organizing information and a form of knowledge representation as a set of concepts in the building energy domain. To enhance a framework and knowledge representation, we adopt ontology. Furthermore, ontology can provide reasoning functionality and context-awareness. We propose a rule-based ontology reasoning system that provides context-awareness. In the proposed system, we design an ontology model for building energy management and make reasoning rules from the knowledge-bases of accumulated building energy saving measures. The proposed system detects energy waste context and provides energy saving measures to eliminate the energy waste context. We implemented the proposed system on a real office building. The implemented ontology reasoning system diagnoses the context of the target building and presents the energy saving measures simultaneously. By use of building energy simulation, the amount of energy saving is estimated when the energy saving measures are applied. The simulation result shows the positive effect of our proposed rule-based ontology reasoning system.},

The study sought to establish a framework for sustainability in Saudi Arabia. In recent times, Saudi Arabia’s market gasoline prices have dropped dramatically, necessitating the kingdom to establish its 2030 vision. The 2030 vision aims to make Saudi Arabia an ideal sustainable society by reducing its reliance on petrol, creating more sustainable buildings, and using renewable energy resources. Due to the lack of a national rating system in the kingdom, LEED will be used as a guideline to formulate a unique rating system suitable for Saudi Arabia and supports the kingdom’s 2030 vision. This research aims to provide a BIM framework to achieve the envisioned sustainability goals and implement sustainable design principles in Saudi Arabia. Further, the study aims to develop a new rating system for Saudi Arabia that is fully integrated with BIM platforms.},

Investment has increased due to the escalating prominence of the benefits of this form of manufacturing in reducing carbon emissions and the influence of extreme weather conditions. A study, called Life Cycle Assessments of The Valentine, found that off-site construction can reduce a project’s carbon emissions by up to 45\%.  While other studies have shown that extreme weather can extend project time scales up to 21\%, causing economic impact throughout the supply chain. Adopting offsite construction methods, can aid in ensuring that construction projects stay on target while reducing carbon emission (Ballesteros-Perez, Smith, Lloyd-Papworth, Cooke 2018). Effects of climate change have pushed the construction industry to move towards off-site manufacturing to reduce these impacts. A key barrier to off-site construction adoption is being able to access and monitor changes to BSI standards simply and efficiently.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for classification of Building Information Model (BIM) checking concepts. Although BIM-based model checking (BMC) and similar terms are widely used, there is a lack of joint understanding of the different types of checking and the use of terms. The study uses an ontological approach to develop a framework with the intention to classify unique concepts of BMC. The following concepts for BMC were identified: A) Compliance checking solutions, separated into: 1) Validation checking and 2) Content checking, and B) Design solution checking, separated into: 3) Smart objects checking and 4) Design option checking. All concepts are presented with principles and examples, and as Linked Data with RDF-graph. The impact of this overview can contribute to improved understanding of BMC, improved understanding and clarification of expectations, and joint terms for common use.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based model checking is maybe the best way to utilize BIM technology and to contribute to the development of new procedures in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry by enabling reuse of knowledge (McHill, 2012). This research seeks to increase the utilisation of BIM-based model checking (BMC) solutions in general, and automated checking of regulations in particular, thereby exploring and suggesting a range of theoretical and practical methods for transforming regulations into applicable digital rules. Regulations include acts and codes with related guidelines and standards.   The target group for use of the developed methods are developers of computable rule specifications – applicable for implementation in applications to be used by the entire construction industry. The specification of the computable rules will then be programmed into software and implemented as new processes for quality assessment of designed solutions or compliance checking.   There has been limited research attention to methods for transforming written building regulations on a large scale into computable rules for BMC that can be specified in an efficient way. This research intends to establish a foundation for the first stage in the development of applicable rules in BMC which can be adapted for use with the major part of the requirements in the regulations which are applicable for digitalisation. Reduction of complexity has been a major guiding star in both the research approach and the development of methods.   The background for this research is deeply rooted in the needs of the AEC industry (architects, engineers, contractors). BMC rules are today mostly focused on clash detection by use of simple geometry-based logic for the conjunction of different parts of building elements like beams and ducts. Free space for a turning circle is another example of a rule based on detection of geometrical conjunction. This type of model-checking replaces visual inspection and the need for information and interpretation is limited. Support of BMC in knowledge-based domains like compliance checking regulations, or compliance with specifications in contracts, is so far limited but is expected to be the new area in BMC. Today’s challenge is therefore to express the regulations in a way that enables valid interpretations of computable rules in BMC.},

  abstract = {The evolution of ICT and BIM systems in the construc- tion domain yield detailed views of buildings and their use throughout their lifespan. These systems also provide a structure around which information about buildings and their effect on surrounding infrastructure can be described in space and time. Thus, when aggregated, information provided by these systems can serve as a semantic structure through which other information can be stored and con- textualized. While bespoke systems have explored these approaches in particular contexts, few if any systems have been constructed to provide a flexible, semantically rich structure that can be used to structure information about any urban landscape at district and regional scales. This paper describes such a system. The Dynamic District Information Server (DDIS) provides a core information structure which can be extended to store as yet undefined information structures and allow these to be reasoned about in the contexts that range from neighbourhoods to regions. In addition, the paper describes how the DDIS can serve as a coordinating process in a tool chain by providing a semantically rich and flexible notification system that al- lows tools in the chain to notify one another when steps in some information process have been completed.},

Achievement of these criteria is assessed by quality control processes conducted throughout construction. This study explores two methods for processing point clouds of bridge girder reinforcement cages, to output positional and dimensional data utilised for quality control. An extended slicing method is first employed to enable the segmentation and classification of 3D rebar within complex bridge girder reinforcement cages. A semantic enrichment method is then used to infer data regarding the the individual rebar and rebar shapes, and improve the accuracy of prior identified information. The proposed algorithms were tested on two point clouds of bridge girder reinforcement cages collected on-site. Positional results, spacing and orientation, reported an average error of less than 2 mm and 0.1 o . An average error of 5\% was reported for the dimensional length of rebar, decreasing to 1\% following the semantic enrichment algorithm. The basis of the presented methodology, including the identification, separation, and grouping for distinct placements of rebar (longitudinal, vertical, and transverse) can be extended for application to other common reinforcement cage archetypes.}

The approach is based on the semantic integration of energy and building information models with a common, or system-agnostic, semantic layer. Standards tend to have a very narrow focus of applicability, so growing a system-agnostic domain model involves the integration of several standards (in this case FSGIM, OpenADR, IFC, SAREF, QUDT, SOSA, NIST Tariff, and BRICK) into a cohesive model. The resulting information layer provides a foundation for round-trip translation, validation, logic, and reasoning, and is part of a cloud-based platform that provides a messaging hub. The approach is currently being tested in a pilot study with 23 buildings in the two primary California power utilities, PG\&E and Southern California Edison.},

  abstract = {Ontologies in a legal expert system must be processed to suit all possible user cases within the field of law of the system. From the logical premises of a de ductive system of express rules of law, legal ontologies may be implied to encompass the combinatorial explosion of possible cases that may lack one or more of the express antecedents in the deductive rule system. Express ontologies in inductive and abductive premises that are associated with the deductive antecedents, may also be adjusted by implication to suit the combinatorial explosion of possible cases. Implied legal ontologies may be determined to suit the user’s case and its legal consequences. The method of this determination and the processing of express black letter law accordingly, is considered by reference to the supplementation of ontology by logic and the supplementation of logic by ontology, in the legal domain; three bases of this method are discussed: law-making power, prior analytics, and the pillars of truth in science and law. Firstly, law-making authority includes the power to determine the logical category of legal premises, and legal truth tables (c.f. Wittgenstein, 1918); law is laid down as legal ontologies with logic attributes or structures. Thus, three ontological posits of law-makers provide for the logical processing of legal information. Rules of law are Major deductive premises laid down, formally or informally, as conditional proposi tions which may be systematised for extended deductive reasoning. Material facts in a case are laid down as inductive instances that particularise or define antecedents in rules of law; they also may be used as Minor deductive premises to determine the outcome of the case. Reasons for rules are laid down as and for strong or weak abductive reasoning. Secondly, legal knowledge engineering requires prior analytics (cf. Aristotle, 1952, originally c.335 BC ) for the acquisition of the expertise; by prior analytics, premises are formalised and systematized for automation of their associated heuristics. Legal epistemology both determines and implements logical structures; through prior an alytics it uses ontologies of legal possibilities and potentialities, to comprehensively predetermine premises for its three forms of legal logic: deduction, induction and abduction. Thirdly, Lord Chancellor Bacon’s (1620) reconstruction of legal epistemology as scientific method for expanding knowledge, systematizes the sources of truth in law and science. It is here developed as a method of prior analytics for constructing an ontology of legal possibilities and legal potentialities. Such ontological construction is essential for determining the heuristics of combinatorial explosion derived from express legal rules to meet the possible cases of users; while legal experts need only construct the relevant part of the combinatorial explosion, for a client’s case, an expert system must be capable of constructing any relevant part to suit a user’s case.}

It should be as easy as possible to compare product data from different manufacturers and integrate them into the planning model without detours. Web technologies not only offer great potential to enhance existing ways of working, but also open up new business models for product manufacturers in the service and IOT domains. However, manufacturers have a legitimate interest to retain control over the disclosure of their product data. Therefore, it is often only available offline and on demand. Of technical interest are therefore solutions, in which a large part of the data autonomy and access control remains on the side of the manufacturer, but the project planner is allowed to search the product data of all manufacturers like an interconnected system. Frequently, such a searchability is ensured by a uniform data schema and storage of the data in a central storage location, a so-called data warehouse. Nonetheless, this stands in contrast to the natural interest of the manufacturer for data sovereignty. This paper focuses on systems that can replace centralized data storage with distributed data management on manufacturer-owned servers, without losing accessibility for planners. Manufacturers should have as much freedom of implementation as possible when establishing the security concept, modeling their data and integrating the proposed approach into their operating procedure.},

  abstract = {Model checking is an important task in the BIM collaboration process to prevent expensive planning errors. The submodels of the individual disciplines are transferred into a coordination model. Part of the transfer is a conversion into an exchange format. The exchange format allows the import into the model checking application. In the model checking application routines are performed to check the model against collisions and building regulation violations. During the transfer into the exchange format, information may get lost, especially with parameters that are not yet part of the exchange format supported by the authoring software. In recent years, ontologies have been investigated as a feasible approach to combine the submodels, since they model data in a flexible manner. Hence in the conversion process to an application-specific ontology, the data structure of the submodels can widely persist, which could lead to smaller information loss in comparison to converting the data into a standardized exchange format. The evaluation of the geometric properties of the building is indispensable for detecting and analyzing collisions. The basis for the connection of the different sub models could be the BOT (Building Topology Ontology), which defines the topological structure of a building and can be used to represent further building information by linking it with other ontologies. The relevant geometric relationships for the collision model checks have to be derived with a geometry kernel. For the research in this paper pythonOCC, a wrapper for the geometry kernel Open CASCADE is used with the Semantic Web's own query language SPARQL, queries can be formulated to analyze the collision relationships in combination with other semantic information. These queries can be used to verify model correctness. By connecting the information from different domains, more sophisticated tests are possible than in an exchange format dependent model checking application. The goal is to integrate the developed functionalities into a project platform. This platform is based on an extensive project description in an ontology-based data model and is connected to different authoring tools for the exchange of information.},

  abstract = {On assignment from the Norwegian building authority (DiBK), Holte Consulting has conducted a status survey of solutions and issues relevant to the development of ByggNett. The assignment has been carried out according to Holte Consulting’s proposal dated June 3, 2013. The status survey is conducted in close cooperation with the client through the fall and winter of 2013. The Norwegian building authority (DiBK) has been commissioned to formulate a strategy for developing an online collaboration platform for the AEC sector. The project is called ByggNett. Holte Consulting has been assigned the project to conduct a status survey of solutions and issues relevant to the development of ByggNett. This survey includes topics such as technology, standards, regulation and legislation. Three topics are central to the survey: - Existing automated and digital solutions for the building application and permission processes; - Overview of initiatives to develop solutions for model checking and digitalization of building application and permission processes; - Use of BIM based on open international standards within the AEC industry and government agencies. This survey includes only the section of the Norwegian Planning and Building Act relating to building applications and permits. The survey reviews only that part of the interaction between a building project and authorities that relates to the building application and permission process. The project on business models for the development and implementation of ByggNett covers the economic and commercial aspects. The concept survey shows the big picture and puts ByggNett in a wider context. Information is obtained by means of literature survey and interviews. Obtained information is systematized, analyzed and compiled. It forms part of qualitative methodology. BIM - The terms Building Information Model (product) and Building Information Modeling (process) are being used interchangeably. People have a conception of the meaning they attach to the term. This may cause significant communication challenges. - Change in human behavior is the greatest challenge regardless of profession, project role or geographic location. - The software for BIM-based design, construction and operation is mature and available. - Maturity and adoption of BIM-based work processes diminish from best practice in the design phase to hardly being present in the operation phase. - Open BIM (IFC) has a stronger position in Europe than in the rest of the world. - There is an inconclusive debate whether one data format for all purposes (IFC) is the right solution for data exchange between involved parties. - A consensual solution for unique identification and semantic description of objects in BIMs is yet to be defined. Currently buildingSMART Data Dictionary is the most mature solution. - The AEC sector is moving into the model server era. - The UK, US, Singapore and the Nordic countries are at the frontier of BIM adoption. - Hong Kong, Korea and Japan are focusing on BIM and developing fast. - Some research into benefits experienced from BIM has been done, especially in the UK. Among reported benefits are cost and time reduction. Exact benefits are difficult to predict. Automatic compliance-checking - Building regulations that before were formulated as prescriptive requirements are today performance based. This is a global trend. Performance based regulations are challenging to present as machine-readable rules. - There are several software vendors developing applications for compliance-checking. The technology appears to be mature. Hence ByggNett probably can be based on existing solutions for automatic compliance-checking. - In all surveyed applications the regulatory data representation is hard-coded into the system and is subject to manual updates by software experts. This makes maintenance and revision demanding and resource consuming. Regional initiatives for developing application and permission platforms CORENET in Singapore was the first serious effort into developing a platform for automated building application and permission. This may be seen as the catalyst which promoted the development of similar solutions in a series of countries. The initiatives found to be of significant interest are: - CORENET (Singapore) - The Planning Portal (UK) - SMARTcodes (US) (not currently active) - DesignCheck (Australia) (not currently active) In addition there are projects with many similarities to the ByggNett concept in the pipeline in Korea, Japan and Denmark. The EU has recently initiated and funded a similar project in Iceland.},

To improve safety management, this study examines the feasibility of the automated framework to classify pre-defined safety behaviors of scaffolding workers and identify whether each safety behavior was carried out. To examine the fidelity of the framework, 35 scaffold workers were studied by using five inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and implementing the five safety regulations. To classify compliance with safety regulations, this study builds on the Gramian angular fields (GAFs) based convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed model is compared to five other classification algorithms. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed method is feasible to identify whether workers comply with safety regulations automatically. This outcome has the potential to improve safety management through personalized worker training or notification during work.}

  abstract = {Building construction industry has significant impact on sustainability. The construction, operation and maintenance of buildings account for approximately 50\% of global energy usage and anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In recent years, the embodied energy and carbon are identified increasingly important in terms of sustainability throughout building life cycle. Incorporation of sustainable development in building structural design becomes undoubtedly crucial. The effective building design requires smart and holistic tools that can process multi-objective and inter-connected domain knowledge to provide genuine sustainable buildings.  With the advancement of information and communication technologies, various methods and techniques have been applied to accomplish the multiple objectives of sustainable development in building design. One of the most successful approaches is building information modelling (BIM), which requires further enhancement of interoperability. The emergence of Semantic Web technology provides more opportunity to improve the information modelling, knowledge management and system integration.  The research presented in this thesis investigates how ontology and Semantic Web rules can be used in a knowledge-based holistic system, in order to integrate information about structural design and sustainability, and facilitate decision-making in design process by recommending appropriate solutions for different use cases. A research prototype namely OntoSCS incorporating OWL ontology and SWRL rules has been developed and tested in typical structural design cases. The holistic approach considers five inter-connected dimensions of sustainability, including structural feasibility, embodied energy and carbon, cost, durability and safety. In addition, the selection of structural material supplier and criteria in sustainability assessment are taken into account as well. This research concludes that the Semantic Web technology can be applied to structural design at early stage to provide multi-criteria optimised solution. The methodology and framework employed in this study can be further adapted as a generic multi-criteria and holistic decision support system for other domains in construction sector.},

  abstract = {Abstract A pronounced gap often exists between expected and actual building performance. The multi-faceted and cross lifecycle causes of this performance gap are found in design assumptions, construction issues and commissioning and operational compromises. Some important factors are firmly rooted in the lack of interoperability around building information. New solutions to the interoperability challenge offer the potential to leverage and reuse available heterogeneous data in a manner that can significantly assist building performance assessment. Linked data provides an open, modular and extensible solution for the challenge. However, in the buildings domain, the integration of rule-based performance metrics and contextual information has yet to be formally established. This paper describes an approach to the provision of in-depth building performance assessment through the integration of OpenMath and linked data. An ontology describing performance metrics in RDF is presented, together with an automated metric evaluation solution using multi-silo queries and computer algebra systems, providing a flexible, automated and extensible mechanism for the assessment of building performance. Building managers and engineers can simultaneously analyse time-series building performance at a range of levels, without burdensome manual intervention such as is the case with traditional solutions. A test implementation on a large university building highlights the potential of this solution.},

  abstract = {Buildings tend to not operate as intended, and a pronounced gap often exists between measured and predicted environmental and energy performance. Although the causes of this ‘performance gap’ are multi-faceted, issues surrounding data integration are key contributory factors. The distributed nature of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry presents many challenges to the effective capture, integration and assessment of building performance data. Not all building data can be described semantically, nor is it feasible to create adapters between many different software tools. Similarly, not all building contextual data can easily be captured in a single product-centric model. This paper presents a new solution to the problem based upon a hybrid architecture that links data which is retained in its original format. The architecture links existing and efficient relational databases storing time-series data and semantically-described building contextual data. The main contribution of this work is an original RDF syntax structure and ontology to represent existing database schema information, and a new mechanism that automatically prepares data streams for processing by rule-based performance definitions. Two test cases evaluate the concept by 1) applying the hybrid architecture to building performance data from an actual building, and 2) evaluating the efficiency of the architecture against a purely RDF-based solution that also stores all of the time-series data in RDF for a virtual building. The hybrid architecture also avoids the duplication of time-series data and overcomes some of the differences found in database schemas and database platforms.},

During its service life, an effective maintenance strategy plays an essential role in keeping its availability and safety. Maintenance work involves a set of participants, activities, and resources, and in this case, tunnel-related data are distributed to heterogeneous information management systems in varying formats, bringing difficulties to implement effective maintenance. This paper proposes an E-maintenance Framework for Public Infrastructure (EFPI), combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), and Semantic Web technologies to help integrate heterogeneous data and expert knowledge, enable information sharing through the whole life cycle, and support maintenance managers to make effective maintenance decisions. A cost estimation case is provided in this paper to illustrate the implementation mechanism and validate the proposed approach.},

In order to make use of this knowledge, a lot of studies have focused on retrieving and storing this knowledge in a systematic and accessible way. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology proves to be a valuable media in extracting data because it provides physical and functional digital models for all the facilities within the life-cycle of the project. Therefore, the combination of the knowledge science with BIM shows great potential in constructing the knowledge map in the field of the AEC industry. Based on literature reviews, this article summarizes the latest achievements in the fields of knowledge science and BIM, in the aspects of (1) knowledge description, (2) knowledge discovery, (3) knowledge storage and management, (4) knowledge inference and (5) knowledge application, to show the state-of-arts and suggests the future directions in the application of knowledge science and BIM technology in the fields of AEC industries. The review indicates that BIM is capable of providing information for knowledge extraction and discovery, by adopting semantic network, knowledge graph and some other related methods. It also illustrates that the knowledge is helpful in the design, construction, operation and maintenance periods of the AEC industry, but now it is only at the beginning stage.},

The compliance of building designs to fire safety regulations holds an utmost importance to ensure adequate fire safety level in the building. The automation in compliance checking process could save significant time and cost as well as avoid inaccuracies. Since regulations are commonly written in human linguistic format, the semantics of the regulations need to be captured and extracted to translate them into computer interpretable rules. This paper demonstrates the process in capturing the semantics of fire safety regulations in Selangor Uniform Building By-Laws 1984 through the adoption of knowledge formalisation method. A framework was developed to provide a comprehensive guideline in capturing the semantics for the classification of fire safety regulations. The framework affirms the reliability of executing this method for other building regulations. This paper is an ongoing research in developing an automated BIM-based fire regulations compliance checking system in Malaysia, whereby the results attained from this paper will be used to extract the semantics of the regulations to create computer interpretable rules.},

The automation of code compliance checking process has been explored since 1960s and becoming more vigorous with the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM). A neutral format, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which is developed under BIM platform had led to better collaboration and information exchange throughout BIM software and development of the checking system. Generally, the structure of an automated system consists of rule interpretation stage, building model preparation stage, rule execution stage and rule reporting stage. Rule interpretation stage is the most vital and complex stage. In interpreting the rules, various techniques have been investigated and applied to employ comprehensive and accurate checking process on the building designs which are mainly in IFC format. The most common techniques used are by utilizing existing software such as Solibri Model Checker, establishing a plug-in application, adopting object-based approach, logical approach and ontological approach. This paper provides a highlight and review on previous studies which successfully employed the appropriate techniques in interpreting the rules for checking purposes.

A one-to-one mapping between a BIM software tool's native data format and the IFC data exchange standard is not possible. This complexity makes it difficult for the translator modules in a BIM software tool to accurately map the IFC elements, causing interoperability problems while exchanging BIM data using IFC. Also, there are mistakes made by the software developers in implementing the mapping to and from IFC data exchange standard, which adds to the issue. A proposed approach to tackle the interoperability problem is to adopt a 'divide and conquer' method by classifying IFC entities as per their relative importance for a discipline and to rectify the interoperability issues of the most important entities first. This paper proposes a framework to classify the IFC entities as per their relative importance with respect to various disciplines and introduce an index called RI (Relative Importance). This paper also suggests the application of the proposed framework in the interoperability measurement (conformance testing) implementation for BIM software tools, and in presenting the results of conformance tests.},

KBimCode is an explicit and computer-readable form written in a scripting language to represent Korea Building Act sentences. KBimCode separates the rule-making process that conventionally dependent on rule-checking software. Based on the approach, KBimCode implemented with its own logic rule components and has been managed with the database. On the other hand, there are several rule-checking software executed with their own rule set. Translating natural language rules into the rule set of each software and translating a rule of specific software into others require a lot of manual effort. The manual translation also hinders interoperability between rule checking software. We address the problem with developing the KBimCode translator for each rule checking software. In this research, we focused on translating KBimCode into an executable code of specific rule checking software, named KBimAssess. KBimCode translator will integrate the rule-making and rule-checking process, which means various stakeholders, even who are not familiar with programming, can easily conduct BIM-enabled rule checking by utilizing KBimCode. Furthermore, the implementation of KBimCode translator is expected to contribute to the enhancement of interoperability between various rule-checking applications.},

Since SHACL was only recently introduced (2017), visual interfaces for the creation of these rules are not investigated in the AEC domain. Current implementations of SHACL focus on the generation of validation reports and not on the creation of SHACL constraints themselves, which requires both Semantic Web knowledge and domain knowledge. This paper proposes a visual programming interface for creating SHACL shapes to improve the ease of creation and editing of constraints for non-semantic web experts with its focus on supporting AEC ontologies and use-cases. To aid that, this paper explores how constraints can be modularized in SHACL so that they are re-usable across use-cases. The proof of concept is demonstrated using a linked building data example. This work is an initial step towards connecting services, wherein, constraints can be created with minimal domain and expert knowledge, and these constraints facilitate checking the validity of information.},

The developed methodology leverages a central spine model that provides a common hierarchical context; various heterogeneous external information sources can be associated with these contexts, creating a homogeneous data network that can be queried using federated SPARQL queries. These distributed sources are, in themselves, registered in a central catalogue in order to facilitate data discovery; the actual data, however, remains under the control of their source organisations. In this way a large, extensible, interconnected network of distributed data describing a built environment can be constructed; this network can be queried centrally to provide customised views of subsets of the data.},

  abstract = {The construction industry is a collaborative environment with the in-volvement of multiple disciplines and activities throughout the Building Lifecy-cle Stages. The collaboration requires the iterative and coordinated exchange of information for significant improvement of the building design, construction and management. The successful representation of these information refine-ments enables the identification of the required level of detail (LOD) for data sharing parameters between the multiple disciplines. Since the last decade, LOD is a promising approach for efficient representation of semantically rich BIM data in different levels. Despite the improvement, there is a lack of effi-cient implementation in building lifecycle functionalities, because of their fun-damental heterogeneity, versatility and adaptability. The proposed approach en-ables the representation of LOD-sensitive BIM data through the formal defini-tion of ontologies. The paper validates this approach based on the concept of competency questions and their respective SPARQL queries. With the demon-stration and validation, the paper provides the conceptual proof for the practical application of the developed approach. The proposed solution can also be easily adaptable and applicable to the present BIM process since the representation of BIM data in different ontologies (BOT, ifcOWL, etc.) are within reach.},

  abstract = {Energy management systems in buildings and their district today use automation systems and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for smart energy management, but they fail to achieve the desired results due to the lack of holistic and optimised decision-making. A reason for this is the silo-oriented approach to the decision-making failing to consider cross-domain data. Ontologies, as a new way of processing domain knowledge, have been increasingly applied to different domains using formal and explicit knowledge representation to conduct smart decision-making. In this PhD research, Real-time Multiscale Smart Energy Management and Optimisation (REMO) ontology was developed, as a cross-domain knowledge-base, which consequently can be used to support holistic real-time energy management in districts considering both demand and supply side optimisation. The ontology here, is also presented as the core of a proposed framework which facilitates the running of AI solutions and automation systems, aiming to minimise energy use, emissions, and costs, while maintaining comfort for users. The state of the art AI solutions for prediction and optimisation were concluded through authors involvement in European Union research projects. The AI techniques were independently validated through action research and achieved about 30 - 40 \% reduction in energy demand of the buildings, and 36\% reduction in carbon emissions through optimisation of the generation mix in the district.  The research here also concludes a smart way to capture the generic knowledge behind AI models in ontologies through rule axiom features, which also meant this knowledge can be used to replicate these AI models in future sites. Both semantic and syntactic validation were performed on the ontology before demonstrating how the ontology supports the various use cases of the framework for holistic energy management. Further development of the framework is recommended for the future which is needed for it to facilitate real-time energy management and optimisation in buildings and their district.},

In addition, the building industry produces a large amount of waste in the construction and deconstruction stages. With respect to such a significant impact on the environment, the demand for sustainable building approaches is increasing. Responsible management of recycling and reuse of building materials and components are an essential aspect of sustainable buildings. In this study, a concept for a material and component bank is developed to reduce eco-footprint of a building by focusing on the reuse of decommissioned building components. This paper presents a framework for developing a Building Information Modelling based tool for buildings in a digitalized form of such a bank. The system includes seven sub-databases, which form the basis of an automated calculation tool for environmental impacts assessment of a design.},

A key element of the Industry 4.0 roadmap is Digital Twin, a digitization  technology that allows the physical and virtual space to communicate. While Digital Twin is rapidly  being adopted in multiple sectors, the technology has the potential to leverage construction data.  This paper synthesizes the current state of practice of Digital Twin in construction by reviewing the  extant literature and proposes a framework that classifies the level of integration in construction into  three subcategories namely: Digital Model, Digital Shadow, and Digital Twin.

The thesaurus built herein included 1097 defect named entities in 23 categories. The NER performance was tested using 69,750 defect complaints through transfer learning of three representative pre-trained language models: Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Korean BERT (KoBERT), and Korean Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately (KoELECTRA). The proposed method achieved an average F1 score of 91.0\% using KoBERT. This NER performance was higher than that of the open benchmark NER performance for clean text (86.1\%).}

At the current rate renovation of old buildings take place, our ecological ambitions for 2050 will only be reached if the total number of renovation projects is tripled and the efficiency within these projects and afterwards drastically rises. Known for the productivity gains they brought in construction of new buildings, digital building techniques have a lot of potential for existing buildings as well. However, for efficient digitisation of existing buildings, the technology stack of the current industry does not always suffice, in terms of collaboration, interdisciplinarity, uncertainties and more. In this project, we aim to address these challenges by integrating digital renovation projects in a Web context. This concept of ‘Linked Building Data’ (LBD) is internationally regarded as ‘the final level of building digitisation’. Our target is use existing and new research to set up an online ecosystem for a shared, Linked Data project environment. This means each project has its own distributed online graph, and a virtually unlimited number of microservices, accessible through an ‘AECO app store’ (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations), can use this data. The proposed ecosystem will enable a network of such modular apps, to address virtually any construction-related topic throughout the entire Life Cycle: from management and simulation to automated rule checking.},

Performing building design and construction engineering raises challenges on data integration and software interoperability. Using Building Information Modeling (BIM) data hub to host and integrate building models is a promising solution to address those challenges, which can ease building design information management. However, the partial model query mechanism of current BIM data hub collaboration model has several limitations, which prevents designers and engineers to take advantage of BIM. To address this problem, we propose a general and effective approach to generate query code based on a Model View Definition (MVD). This approach is demonstrated through a software prototype called QueryGenerator. By demonstrating a case study using multi-zone air flow analysis, we show how our approach and tool can help domain experts to use BIM to drive building design with less labour and lower overhead cost.},

Thus, a new approach taking advantage of building information model (BIM) and ontology is proposed in this paper to facilitate the process of green building evaluation. Information-rich BIM serves as the provider of multidisciplinary data required for green building evaluation while green building evaluation ontology (GBEOntology) is used for representing fragmented information included in evaluation standards. The reasoning process is realized in a Jess rule engine combining semantic web rule language (SWRL) rules and ontology web language (OWL) ontology. The proposed approach can save time and realize the reuse of green building evaluation standard knowledge. An implemented test case validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach by looking at the example of Evaluation Standard for Green Building (GB/T50378-2014) of China.},

Specifically, a data fusion stage and several information-based control mechanisms are involved in the use of the two technologies. A designed BFP ontology is considered as the semantic model and basis of data fusion between the static building geometric information and the dynamic sensing data. The above information is incorporated into a DT data model, which is considered as the mapping of physical space. Moreover, rule models and process models are developed to achieve intelligent control mechanisms and keep the DT data model synced with the physical space. A case study based on a fire accident simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of the use of DTs and semantic web technologies.}

However, the traditional code compliance checking process relies heavily on human work. To help the users better understand the checking process, this study proposes a gray-box checking technique and a BIM-based (Building Information Modeling)automated code compliance checking methodology that leverages ontology. The proposed approach contains a code ontology, a designed model ontology, a merged ontology, a code compliance checking ontology, a set of mapping rules, and a set of checking rules. During the checking process, the ontologies provide knowledge bases, and the rules provide necessary logic. A five-step roadmap is proposed for code ontology development for domain experts. For the time being, pre-processing is applied to create the designed model ontology to achieve time saving. Next, an ontology mapping procedure between the code and the designed model ontology is executed to obtain the merged ontology. In the ontology mapping procedure, the mapping rules aim to mitigate the semantic ambiguity between design information and regulatory information and enrich building information's semantics. Subsequently, rule-based reasoning is applied based on the checking rules and the merged ontology for checking reports generation. Finally, according to Chinese building codes, an automated code compliance checking platform is implemented for real construction projects to validate the proposed methodology.},

We trigger execution and description of Iterations by Regimenting Self-Attention (IRSA) in one (or a combination) of three ways: 1) Using strong repetitive structure in an example of an execution path of a target program for one particular input, 2) Prompting with fragments of execution paths, and 3) Explicitly forbidding (skipping) self-attention to parts of the generated text. On a dynamic program execution, IRSA leads to larger accuracy gains than replacing the model with the much more powerful GPT-4. IRSA has promising applications in education, as the prompts and responses resemble student assignments in data structures and algorithms classes. Our findings hold implications for evaluating LLMs, which typically target the in-context learning: We show that prompts that may not even cover one full task example can trigger algorithmic behaviour, allowing solving problems previously thought of as hard for LLMs, such as logical puzzles. Consequently, prompt design plays an even more critical role in LLM performance than previously recognized.},

For this purpose, a BIM (Building Information Modelling)-centred framework has been designed, where BIM contains all the static information modelled from the building, including sensors. A dynamic database is modelled under the IFC paradigm to be able to link data between both repositories and, thus, keep record of dynamic data that the building periodically generates. With the aim of demonstrating its functionality, CARTIF-III building has been used where, on one hand, BIM model deals with thermal zones and sensors. On the other hand, dynamic database stores data coming from the “modelled” sensors, as well as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The key point is the integration of both data resources so that self-inspection procedures could be applied in buildings.},

  abstract = {The current design of infrastructure facilities is mainly driven by the application of guidelines, codes and international standards. The complex interpretation and geometric representation of those rules impedes the dynamic search for alternative solutions. Parallel to this, in recent years there has been an increasing tendency toward the adoption of 3D modeling solutions. Of particular benefit in the design of infrastructure facilities is the use of parametric modeling systems since they allow the definition of flexible models that can easily be adapted to satisfy changes in the boundary conditions. By defining dependencies and constraints, engineers are able to capture the underlying engineering knowledge in the parametric model. However, the design knowledge that can be defined by those instruments is limited to a reduced number of constraints and simple algebraic relations among parameters that are clearly insufficient to describe the complexity of engineering rules. To close this technological gap, this paper presents a novel knowledge-based engineering (KBE) approach that captures the design knowledge engineers apply in the interpretation and generation of infrastructure models based on rules specific for infrastructure facilities. To achieve this, distinct knowledge units named logic models capture the generation knowledge needed to convert the abstract information engineers must deal with into a corresponding parametric geometry model. In addition, this paper presents a methodology to integrate logic models with parametric design systems. To this end, logic models are introduced as a new set of domain-specific features responsible for the generation and management of the geometry, connecting the results with other part of the model by advanced procedural geometry dependencies. Finally, the proposed methodology is verified in a real case study for a suburban railway tunnel that is in the planning stage in the city of Munich, Germany. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the proposed approach and an outlook on future developments.},

Indeed, SW languages like Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Language Ontology (OWL) have been used for various purposes like information modeling, automatic rules’ checking. Their massive adoption is due mainly to their ability to capture deep semantics, their standardization and their large adoption. At the base of semantic applications, we find ontologies. Their construction is time consuming and involves domain experts and SW engineers. It is thus interesting for experts to have tools which could help them enrich automatically ontologies from textual resources. In this paper, we bridge this gap through an approach which aims to provide automatically an OWL expression of a given concept from its natural language definition. This formalization process uses foremost Industry Foundation Classes entities. A first evaluation of this approach gives promising results.},

While this is an absolute advantage there are also problems regarding the daily work of experts because the simulations costs much time and before simulations can be done the configuration can be very huge and the pre-processing erroneous. To overcome these problems an eeBIM-ontology-based (Energy Enhanced BIM) framework is proposed applying inference rules to pre-check the input data and to pre-analyse the energy performance, before the simulation phase will start. The ontology specification provides concepts and relations to describe the building, the external data like the climate data as well as the linking between the BIM-concepts and the external data. Furthermore, constraints and calculation methods are transferred as far as possible into logical rules. The surrounding ontology platform enables the integration of the input data and manages the execution of the calculation methods. It also defines external connection points for calculation methods, which cannot appropriate represented in rules.},

This is due to various factors encountered in the different phases of the building life cycle, i.e., inaccuracy of the specifications used in the simulation tools during design phase, poor quality of the on-site practices conducted throughout the construction, inadequate verification of the equipment installed in the building during commissioning phase, and limited analysis of the data collected from the equipment during the operational phase. With the aim of reducing the EPGap, we present an energy management framework defined in the context of an EU-funded H2020 project, HIT2GAP1. The proposed solution provides several services from collecting heterogeneous on-site data, to advanced data analysis and visualization tools designed for the different actors of a building (e.g., building/facility/energy manager, occupants, etc.), for building energy performance optimization. In this paper, we give an overview on the proposed framework architecture and detail its different functionalities, with a particular focus on the solution Core Platform, which is in charge of orchestrating the different components, storing and structuring the data, and providing pre-processing services.},

  abstract = {Abstract Since the early 2000s, building information modeling (BIM) has been used through the entire project life cycle to facilitate effective project collaboration and integration of data to support project activities. Despite the successful applications of BIM in the design and construction stages, the use of BIM for preconstruction planning has not gained wide acceptance as in other project phases. The integration of BIM and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the planning process during the design and preconstruction stages. However, this integration suffers from a lack of interoperability across the geospatial and BIM domains. Semantic web technology is used in this study to convey meaning, which is interpretable by both construction project participants as well as BIM and geographic information systems (GIS) applications processing the transferred data. To achieve this, we first translate building's elements and GIS data into a semantic web data format. Then we use a set of standardized ontologies for construction operations to integrate and query the heterogeneous spatial and temporal data. Finally, we use a query language to access and acquire the data in semantic web format. Through two scenario examples, the potential usefulness of the proposed methodology is validated.},

Despite the improvement, there is a lack of efficient implementation and management of building life cycle functionalities in existing BIM solutions, because of their fundamental heterogeneity, complexity, and adaptability. This research focuses on these issues and addresses a clear perception through analysis of BLS from various standards and norms. The paper concentrates on the demonstration of efficient representation of various BLS through the ontological approach and their effective involvement in BIM data management.

  abstract = {The World Wide Web has provided a vast distributed information space that is primarily designed for human consumption. The enmeshment of the Web and various business processes has made it imperative to define business information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception; construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information, it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently, the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) data model. Several researchers have investigated the limitations of IFCs data model for interoperability among heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared building ontology that models building domain element types and element relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element properties to the shared building ontology. SWRL rules are used for mapping element properties from one domain to another. An example demonstrates how the developed approach can facilitate project information sharing between design and estimating domains.},

However, these formats do not support flexible automated product search and data integration. This paper describes the use of Semantic Web technologies in combination with BIM-based visual programming language (VPL) to automatically integrate product data from external databases. To facilitate data integration, we introduced a method to semantically represent product data linked with the CEN/TS 17623:2021 standard using ontologies in web ontology language (OWL). The study has focused on the use case of a manufacturer of lighting products. Results show that building designers are able to execute a more efficient product search that satisfies their query requirements and returns suitable products of their choice from the manufacturer's database based on their requests. This approach eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually entering product data into BIM software.},

A systematic literature review has been conducted to investigate benefits and limitations of using the SW and LD technologies for developing product data templates for information exchanges between the building and product manufacturing industries in comparison with the conventional approach of information ex-changes using the openBIM standards. Results show that SW and LD could apport considerable benefits to the information exchange in the building sector.

However, many official documentation still lacks (good) code example and it is one of the common documentation issues as found by several studies. Hence in this paper, we consider automatic code example generation for documentation, a direction less explored by the existing research. We employ Codex, a GPT-3 based model, pre-trained on both natural and programming languages to generate code examples from source code and documentation given as input. Our preliminary investigation on 40 scikit-learn methods reveals that this approach is able to generate good code examples where 72.5\% code examples were executed without error (passability) and 82.5\% properly dealt with the target method and documentation (relevance). We also find that incorporation of error logs (produced by the compiler while executing a failed code example) in the input further improves the passability from 72.5\% to 87.5\%. Thus, our investigation sets the base of documentation-specific code example generation and warrants in-depth future studies.},

  abstract = {Despite the advancements in digital technologies, the current building design examination practice is 2D and paper-based, and a large number of 2D plans and drawings need to be collated and interpreted to examine if the proposed designs comply with building regulations. Subsequently, it is prone to human errors that make sustainable and consistent design difficult. Although Building Information Modelling (BIM) is recognised as a means to transform the current practice into a more sustainable and productive practice, BIM has rarely been adopted in building design examination. This research aims to identify the reasons for the low uptake of BIM and to examine the feasibility of BIM for building design examination through a focus group interview and workshop. A lack of proper BIM training is identified as the most critical barrier to adopting BIM. Building design examiners indicate that BIM adoption requires consistent efforts with empirical errors, since the existing work processes are not flexible enough to embrace BIM instantly without proper BIM training. An average of three days can be saved by using BIM for a building regulations check. This research revealed that BIM is feasible for building regulation checking, and the low uptake is mainly caused by a lack of awareness of the BIM capabilities.},

However, the process of monitoring the scaffold is labor-intensive because it is conducted by the subjective observation of safety managers. To address this issue, we propose an automatic scaffold 3D reconstruction method using 3D point cloud data acquired using a robot dog. The method consists of three steps: 1) data acquisition of scaffold point clouds through a robot dog scanning system, 2) deep learning-based 3D semantic segmentation, and 3) automatic formation of a 3D CAD model. We created 15 robot dog datasets for training the segmentation model. The proposed method was tested at a different site where a scaffold with a representative structure was attached to the wall. The proposed method demonstrated an excellent performance of point cloud segmentation with a 90.84\% F1 score.}

First, we drew the criteria from literature review to analyze the building code. And then, we analyzed building code and sorted objects and properties for automated building code checking. After that we made mapping table between the sorted data and IFC specification. Using the mapping table, we developed pre-specification about building codes information that does not exist in IFC specification. And the defined information can be used to develop the BIM modeling guide and national building permission system. The pre-specification support increasing the interoperability between user and automated building code checking system.

However, BIM-based facility information from the construction phase is difficult to access and use during the operation and maintenance phase. This occurs because the BIM information is not utilized well in facility management (FM). In this research, we propose an approach to effectively manage BIM-based FM information by linking the BIM-based building elements and FM work information in an FM system database. We present a Semantic Web-based FM information system that semantically links BIM data to relevant historical work records. The proposed ontology was evaluated using a sample dataset of the architectural maintenance work records of an office building. Using the proposed approach, facility managers will be able to increase their efficiency in searching related work records that consider shared BIM objects by enhancing the interoperability and accessibility of FM data via the Semantic Web.},

The approach depicted in this paper enables the software developers to figure out the logical relations in order to compose KBimCode and its databases. KBimCode is a computer-readable form of Korean Building Code sentences based on a logic rule-based mechanism. Two types of relational logic definition are described in this paper. First type is a logic definition of relation between code sentences. Due to the complexity of Korean Building code structure that consists of decree, regulation or ordinance, an intensive analysis of sentence relations has been performed. Code sentences have a relation based on delegation or reference each other. Another type is a relational logic definition in a code sentence based on translated atomic sentence(TAS) which is an explicit form of atomic sentence(AS). The analysis has been performed because the natural language has intrinsic ambiguity which hinders interpreting embedded meaning of Building Code. Thus, both analyses have been conducted for capturing accurate meaning of building permit-related requirements as a part of the logic rule-based mechanism.},

  abstract = {The Building Information Modeling (BIM) and its applications enable an automatic building permit process based on 3D building models and their associated information. A crucial part of the building permit process is the interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other countries and their projects have developed a certain type of rule-translation methods, KBimCode, part of the KBim application series, has been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an automatic, BIM-based building permit system on top of the current e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule reviewers. This paper describes a KBimCode visual language that is easy-to-write and intuitive because it uses visual symbols instead of textual coding.HighlightsKBVL is an approach to computer-readable building code in visual form.KBVL supports easy-to-make rules for complicated building design rules.This paper demonstrates KBVL using KBimCode for Korean Building permit requirements.},

  abstract = {Fire safety regulations impose very strict requirements on building design, especially for buildings built with combustible materials. It is believed that it is possible to improve the management of these regulations with a better integration of fire protection aspects in the building information modeling (BIM) approach. A new BIM-based domain is emerging, the automated code checking, with its growing number of dedicated approaches. However, only very few of these works have been dedicated to managing the compliance to fire safety regulations in timber buildings. In this paper, the applicability to fire safety in the Canadian context is studied by constituting and executing a complete method from the regulations text through code-checking construction to result analysis. A design science approach is used to propose a code-checking method with a detailed analysis of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) in order to obtain the required information. The method starts by retrieving information from the regulation text, leading to a compliance check of an architectural building model. Then, the method is tested on a set of fire safety regulations and validated on a building model from a real project. The selected fire safety rules set a solid basis for further development of checking rules for the field of fire safety. This study shows that the main challenges for rule checking are the modeling standards and the elements’ required levels of detail. The implementation of the method was successful for geometrical as well as non-geometrical requirements, although further work is needed for more advanced geometrical studies, such as sprinkler or fire dampers positioning.},

  abstract = {The right response to someone who says "get ready for a party" is deeply influenced by meaning and context. For a smart home assistant (e.g., Google Home), the ideal response might be to survey the available devices in the home and change their state to create a festive atmosphere. Current practical systems cannot service such requests since they require the ability to (1) infer meaning behind an abstract statement and (2) map that inference to a concrete course of action appropriate for the context (e.g., changing the settings of specific devices). In this paper, we leverage the observation that recent task-agnostic large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 embody a vast amount of cross-domain, sometimes unpredictable contextual knowledge that existing rule-based home assistant systems lack, which can make them powerful tools for inferring user intent and generating appropriate context-dependent responses during smart home interactions. We first explore the feasibility of a system that places an LLM at the center of command inference and action planning, showing that LLMs have the capacity to infer intent behind vague, context-dependent commands like "get ready for a party" and respond with concrete, machine-parseable instructions that can be used to control smart devices. We furthermore demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation that puts an LLM in control of real devices, showing its ability to infer intent and change device state appropriately with no fine-tuning or task-specific training. Our work hints at the promise of LLM-driven systems for context-awareness in smart environments, motivating future research in this area.},

In spite of this, the geography of their development and diffusion has not received significant attention in the literature. We address this with an analysis of Deep Learning (DL), a core technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly being recognized as the latest GPT. We identify DL papers in a novel dataset from ArXiv, a popular preprints website, and use CrunchBase, a technology business directory to measure industrial capabilities related to it. After showing that DL conforms with the definition of a GPT, having experienced rapid growth and diffusion into new fields where it has generated an impact, we describe changes in its geography. Our analysis shows China's rise in AI rankings and relative decline in several European countries. We also find that initial volatility in the geography of DL has been followed by consolidation, suggesting that the window of opportunity for new entrants might be closing down as new DL research hubs become dominant. Finally, we study the regional drivers of DL clustering. We find that competitive DL clusters tend to be based in regions combining research and industrial activities related to it. This could be because GPT developers and adopters located close to each other can collaborate and share knowledge more easily, thus overcoming coordination failures in GPT deployment. Our analysis also reveals a Chinese comparative advantage in DL after we control for other explanatory factors, perhaps underscoring the importance of access to data and supportive policies for the successful development of this complex, `omni-use' technology.},

However, each building has all the burden of converting information from different models to its information model prior to using it.

  abstract = {The recent advances in the automation of metadata normalization and the invention of a unified schema --- Brick --- alleviate the metadata normalization challenge for deploying portable applications across buildings. Yet, the lack of compatibility between existing metadata normalization methods precludes the possibility of comparing and combining them. While generic machine learning (ML) frameworks, such as MLJAR and OpenML, provide versatile interfaces for standard ML problems, they cannot easily accommodate the metadata normalization tasks for buildings due to the heterogeneity in the inference scope, type of data required as input, evaluation metric, and the building-specific human-in-the-loop learning procedure. We propose Plaster, an open and modular framework that incorporates existing advances in building metadata normalization. It provides unified programming interfaces for various types of learning methods for metadata normalization and defines standardized data models for building metadata and timeseries data. Thus, it enables the integration of different methods via a workflow, benchmarking of different methods via unified interfaces, and rapid prototyping of new algorithms. With Plaster, we 1) show three examples of the workflow integration, delivering better performance than individual algorithms, 2) benchmark/analyze five algorithms over five common buildings, and 3) exemplify the process of developing a new algorithm involving time series features. We believe Plaster will facilitate the development of new algorithms and expedite the adoption of standard metadata schema such as Brick, in order to enable seamless smart building applications in the future.},

  abstract = {Interoperability in the Internet of Things relies on a common data model that captures the necessary semantics for vendor independent application development and data exchange. However, traditional systems such as those in building management are vertically integrated and do not use a standard schema. A typical building can consist of thousands of data points. Third party vendors who seek to deploy applications like fault diagnosis need to manually map the building information into a common schema. This mapping process requires deep domain expertise and a detailed understanding of intricacies of each building's system. Our framework - Scrabble - reduces the mapping effort significantly by using a multi-stage active learning mechanism that exploits the structure present in a standard schema and learns from buildings that have already been mapped to the schema. Scrabble uses conditional random fields with transfer learning to represent unstructured building information in a reusable intermediate representation. This reusable representation is mapped to the schema using a multilayer perceptron. Our novel semantic model based active learning mechanism requires only minimal input from domain experts to interpret esoteric, idiosyncratic data points. We have evaluated Scrabble on five buildings with thousands of different entities and our method outperforms prior work by 59\%/162\% higher Accuracy/Macro-averaged-F1 in a building when 10 examples are provided by an expert in both cases. Scrabble achieves 99\% Accuracy with 100--160 examples for buildings with thousands of points while the other baselines cannot.}

A large body of research has been gathered over the last 50 years, supported by many Prolog implementations. Many implementations are still actively developed, while new ones keep appearing. Often, the features added by different systems were motivated by the interdisciplinary needs of programmers and implementors, yielding systems that, while sharing the “classic” core language, in particular, the main aspects of the ISO-Prolog standard, also depart from each other in other aspects. This obviously poses challenges for code portability. The field has also inspired many related, but quite different languages that have created their own communities. This article aims at integrating and applying the main lessons learned in the process of evolution of Prolog. It is structured into three major parts. First, we overview the evolution of Prolog systems and the community approximately up to the ISO standard, considering both the main historic developments and the motivations behind several Prolog implementations, as well as other logic programming languages influenced by Prolog. Then, we discuss the Prolog implementations that are most active after the appearance of the standard: their visions, goals, commonalities, and incompatibilities. Finally, we perform a SWOT analysis in order to better identify the potential of Prolog and propose future directions along with which Prolog might continue to add useful features, interfaces, libraries, and tools, while at the same time improving compatibility between implementations.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) does not change the purpose for performing a task related to delivering a facility – only the means by which the purpose is achieved. Currently, no common language exists for the purposes of implementing BIM. This lack of a common language makes it challenging to precisely communicate with others the purposes for implementing BIM. The goal of this research is to create that common language by developing a BIM Use Ontology. A BIM Use (Use) is defined as a method of applying Building Information Modeling during a facility's life-cycle to achieve one or more specific objectives. The BIM Use Ontology (the Ontology) provides a shared vocabulary that is applied to model (or express) the BIM Uses, including the type of objects (or terms), and concepts, properties, and relationships that exist. The methods performed to develop the BIM Use Ontology included: 1) defining domain and scope, 2) acquiring domain knowledge, 3) documenting domain terms, 4) integrating domain terms, 5) evaluating (refining and validating) the BIM Use Ontology, and 6) documenting the BIM Use Ontology. Overall, the BIM Use Ontology classified over 550 BIM terms into a defined ontological structure. Before the BIM Use Ontology was finalized, this structure was validated through competency questions, term mapping, industry interviews, and focus group meetings. The research methodology implemented to develop the BIM Use Ontology was designed based on the following criteria: clarity, comprehensiveness, extendibility, minimal bias, and minimal ontological commitment. The BIM Use Ontology primarily classifies the BIM Uses based on the purpose of implementing BIM on a facility or within an organization; and secondarily classifies BIM Uses based on characteristics of the BIM Use. The BIM Use Ontology classifies BIM Uses into five primary BIM Use Purposes: 1) Gather, 2) Generate, 3) Analyze, 4) Communicate, and 5) Realize. After the BIM Use Purpose is determined, an implementer can identify more detailed BIM Use Characteristics such as facility element, facility phase, author discipline, or level of development. Depending upon a particular implementation of BIM, the process, information, infrastructure, maturity, benefits, and references are determined. The characteristics make the BIM Use Ontology applicable and usable by industry. The BIM Use Ontology provides a structure for the purposes by which BIM can be implemented during the life-cycle of a facility. The BIM Use Ontology provides the fundamental terminology and organizational structure for the purposes for which BIM is implemented throughout the life-cycle of a facility. The BIM Use Ontology can be applied within procurement language and BIM planning to define exact requirements of various parties. The BIM Use Ontology can also be applied to standardize process and information exchanges. This standardization is critical to the U.S. National BIM Standard. Overall, the BIM Use Ontology allows for better communication of the purposes for implementing Building Information Modeling throughout the life of a facility.},

  abstract = {The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are a common file-based open standard to describe Building Information Models. An IFC file can describe a building model to a level of detail suitable for production use and unite information pertaining to all stakeholders involved in a construction project. IFC files can possibly constitute up to gigabytes of data. Processing the full extent of this data can be time consuming. Considering the multi-disciplinary nature of our industry it may also be unnecessary for the use case at hand. Therefore, the retrieval of relevant subsets, whether spatially, based on discipline, or others, is necessary to effectively consume such datasets in downstream applications. However, prevalent encoding forms of IFC models are text-based. And even though, in terms of file size, the most prevalent encoding, called IFC-SPF, can be rather efficient, by nature, it does not facilitate random access seeking in the file and no ordering is imposed to the definition of elements in the file. Therefore, at worst, the entire file needs to be traversed in order to find instances of interest. Furthermore, text-based data is slow to parse in comparison to its binary equivalent. This paper introduces a binary serialization for IFC models as an alternative to prevalent text-based formats. It is based on an existing open standard called HDF5. An implementation for the translation of conventional IFC instance models into HDF5 is provided under and open source license. HDF5 is a binary and hierarchical data format. The hierarchical nature allows random access to specific instances. Other benefits include transparent compression and mechanisms for linking and mounting external files. The compressed HDF5 format yields a significant reduction of file sizes as compared to IFC-SPF models. In three use cases is assessed that extracting data from the model, can occur in near-constant time in relation to the size of the model, contrary to linear time using IFC-SPF models. The translation into HDF5 files follows an existing ISO standardized mapping from EXPRESS instance models, the parent standard of IFC. The self-documenting nature of HDF5 enables incorporating additional attributes that are not part of the schema. In order to improve visualisation one can cache calculated information such as triangulated geometry for complex CSG geometries that are computationally complex to compute. In addition, incorporating inverse attribute values as part of the instantiation allows to further optimize the generation of subgraphs.},

  abstract = {The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are a prevalent data model in which Building Information Models can be exchanged, typically with a file-based nature. Processing the full extent of these models can be time-consuming. Considering the multi-disciplinary nature of the construction industry, stakeholders will typically only be interested in a small subset, depending on the purpose of the exchange. Therefore, the retrieval of relevant subsets, whether spatially, based on discipline, or others, is necessary to effectively consume such datasets in downstream applications. Prevalent encoding forms of IFC models are text-based and do not facilitate random-access seeking within the file and do not impose an ordering on the definition of elements within the file. Therefore, typically, the entire file needs to be read in order to find the data of interest. Furthermore, text-based data is slower to parse in comparison to binary data. This paper assesses a binary serialization format originating from the family of EXPRESS standards. It is based on an existing open, binary, hierarchical data format called HDF5 that allows random access to specific instances and therefore efficient retrieval of relevant subsets. The block-level, transparent compression yields a reduction of file sizes as compared to traditional serializations. Fully specified datatypes embedded in the exchange guarantee interoperable use. In this paper, several serialization profiles are introduced that cater to specific use cases by governing storage settings. Advanced functionality from the HDF5 library is applied to offer novel paradigms for fine-grained access rights, varying level of detail, revision management and aggregation of aspect models.},

  abstract = {Multi-disciplinary and long-term use of geometric and semantic construction information With the transition to Building Information Modeling (BIM) within the construction sector, industry stakeholders exchange detailed building engineering information in semantic and computer readable formats. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are the main open and vendor neutral standard according to which this information is structured. Open issues arise when extending and generalizing the use of IFC data to other related disciplines, such as cultural heritage documentation, digital long- term preservation, land registration and cadastral management, geospatial analysis, building asset management and civil engineering. These issues originate from the use of unrelated ontologies, mismatching levels of detail, different geometric modeling paradigms,inefficientstorageofinformation,lackoffullfeaturedquerylanguagesand no means for mutation management. This dissertation is aimed at alleviating some of the technical complications of multi-disciplinary and long-term use of building models. To provide more efficient storage mechanisms for IFC instance models, a binary format is introduced, based on the open HDF5 standard for scientific computing. Re- quired storage space and access times to specific information is decimated relating to the state of the art of clear-text encoding of exchange models, by means of the hier- archical and fixed-length storage of instances, an instantiation of inverse attributes, machine-native storage of number literals and transparently applied block-level com- pression. Storage space is reduced to as little as 11\% of original encoding for large models, but the most profound reduction is in access times to descriptive meta-data, whichcanbederivedinaslittleas0.0067\%to3.5\%ofthetimerequiredonthecurrently prevalent formats, for simple tasks and more elaborate tasks respectively. Due to the self-descriptive storage paradigm and optionally applied checksum filters, advances are made to resilient long-term digital storage. Advanced features such as internal ref- erences and mounting, assembling various files by the end-user, contribute to specific use cases in industry such as varying levels of detail and the aggregation of several aspect models provided independently by different stakeholders. Currently, the most viable options to query for information encoded in building models are provided by the standards and tools that are part of the Semantic Web ecosystem, with in particular RDF as a generic storage method and SPARQL as a query language. Those generic RDF tools are compared to querying the novel binary serialized models directly, with an implemented SPARQL query engine that operates directly on top of this format, eliminating additional indirections that stem from the RDF conversion process. No additional optimization or indexing step is necessary as opposed to the state of the art RDF storage engines, due to the efficient storage. As such, the approach presented in this dissertation yields the most succinct queryable format for BIM models and is fastest in some of the cases where query paths follow the direction in which attributes are defined in IFC. Due to the complicated and implicit definitions of the geometric engineering con- structs in BIM models, querying and reasoning on such geometric constructs directly without a prior evaluation step is not feasible. Especially in the context of the Se- mantic Web, such constructs cannot be efficiently stored due to the use of ordered sequences for example for polygonal boundaries. In this dissertation an alternative description of IFC geometries is provided as Well-Known Text, a standard originating from the geospatial domain for human readable and explicit geometry definitions with well-defined semantics and relational predicates. Comparing to the original RDF representation of IFC, for specific files, a reduction in triple counts of up to 96\% is achieved. Formoregeneralfilesfromindustryreductionsof44\%and52\%arerealized. Procedures are provided to translate the product-centric solid geometries of build- ing elements into representations that cater to other modeling paradigms, such as (a) thermal analysis, where thin-walled interfaces between thermal zones are required and (b) geospatial analysis where a complete manifold building envelope is desired for topological and geometrical queries. Anapproachispresentedtodetectmodificationstoabuildingovertimebypairing themanuallymodeledIFCengineeringgeometrieswithpointcloudsdirectlyobtained from acquisition devices. For this purpose a minimal schema extension is provided that, with an addition of 13 new entities, enables to efficiently express, annotate and link point cloud segments to individual building elements. Due to the various inde- pendent layers of compression: grid discretization, quantization and general purpose compression at the file format level, a 68\% compression ratio is obtained compared to the independent storage of point cloud and building model separately. In addi- tion to change detection, the confluence of point cloud and building model facilitates use cases such as structural health monitoring to assess the gradual deflections that elements incur over time and hybrid modeling approaches for detailed ornaments in digital cultural heritage documentation.},

  abstract = {To date, widely implemented and full-featured query languages for building models in their native exchange formats do not exist. While interesting proposals exist for querying Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models, their functionality is often incomplete and their semantics not precisely defined. With the introduction of the ifcOWL ontology as an equivalent to the IFC schema in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), an option to represent such models in RDF (Resource Description Framework, a general information modeling method) is provided, and such models can be queried using SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). The size of data sets in complex building projects, however, renders the use of clear-text encoded RDF infeasible in many cases. A SPARQL implementation, compatible with ifcOWL, is proposed, directly atop a standardized binary serialization format for IFC building models. This novel format is the binary equivalent of traditional IFC serialization formats but with more compact storage and less overhead than the graph serialization in RDF. The format is based on ISO 10303-26 and relies on an open standard for organizing large amounts of data: Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5). Due to hierarchical partitioning and fixed-length records, only small subsets of the data are read to answer queries, improving efficiency. A prototypical implementation of the query engine is provided in the Python programming language. In several realistic use cases, the proposed system performs equivalent to or better than the state of the art in SPARQL querying on building models. For large datasets, the proposed storage format results in files that are 2–3 times smaller than the current, most concise, RDF databases while offering a platform-neutral, containerized exchange file.},

The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment.},

The application of the BERA Language aims to provide efficiency in defining, analyzing and checking rules. Specific example applications implemented in this dissertation are on the evaluation of two key aspects: building circulation and spatial programming.     The objective of this study is to accomplish an effectiveness and ease of use without precise knowledge of general-purpose languages that are conventionally used in BIM software development. To achieve the goal, this study proposes an abstraction of the universe of discourse - it is the BERA Object Model (BOM). It is a human-centered abstraction of complex state of building models rather than the computation-oriented abstraction. By using BOM, users can enjoy the ease of use and portability of BIM data, rather than complex and platform-dependent data structures. This study also has reviewed and demonstrated its potential for extensibility of BOM. Not only its lateral extensions such as structural building elements, but also the vertical extensions such as additional properties for existing BOM objects are good examples. In current BERA Language Tool, many computed and derived properties/relations have been proposed and implemented, as well as some basic data directly from the given building model.     Target users of the BERA Language are domain experts such as architects, designers, reviewers, owners, managers, students, etc., rather than BIM software developers. It means that the people who are interested in the building environment rule and analysis are the potential users. The BERA Language Tool comprises many libraries to alleviate common but unnecessary problems and limitations that are encountered when users attempt to analyze and evaluate building models using commercially available tools. Combined with other libraries which populate rich and domain-specific datasets for certain purposes, the BERA Language will be fairly versatile to define rules and analyze various building environmental conditions.},

Over the past decade, various efforts to develop an efficient rule-based checking process and platform have been made in different countries. Even though there is one commercial tool named Solibri Model Checker, none so far has been advanced enough to fully automate the design checking process and meet the requirements of the industry. This study aims at investigating and comparing the current rule-based design checking approaches including IfcDoc, KBim, ePlanCheck, ACABIM, and SNACC, identifying the similarities and the differences of the existing approaches. The authors who have been involved in each process of rule-checking tool development had a long discussion regarding their experience and lessons learned and found that the five approaches were based on a similar process and method to translate requirements, define rules, check design procedures, develop validation features, and report checking results.},

As the growing area of Building Information Modeling (BIM), there has been a need to develop highly customized domain-specific languages for handling issues in building models in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry sector. The BERA Language, one of the domain-specific languages, deals with building information models in an intuitive way in order to ensure the quality of design and assess the design programming requirements using user-defined rules in the early design phases. To accomplish these goals, the BERA Language provides the capabilities for an effectiveness and ease of use without precise knowledge of general-purpose languages that are conventionally used in BIM software development.

This paper represents the implementation issues of the BERA Language associated with the building information models, their mapping into the building data structure, and their instantiation and execution. In addition, Portability of the language, extensibility and platform-dependent issues are involved in the BERA Language implementation. The implementation described in this paper is based on the use of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as given building information models, Solibri Model Checker® (SMC) as an IFC engine, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as a compilation and execution environment.},

However, most defect data are stored in unstructured ways, resulting in the fundamental problem of data utilization. This paper proposes a novel framework by using BIM and linked data technologies for sharing defect data between heterogeneous data sources in a new way. To demonstrate, a defect ontology is developed, work context information is extracted from BIM models, extracted BIM data is converted to RDF format, and SPARQL queries are implemented. The proposed approach could help BIM software applications to take into account information stemming from the defect management domain. Also, it can reduce data search time and improve the accuracy of search results as well. Therefore, this framework may enable reductions of defect occurrence and improvements in current defect management practices.},

  abstract = {Each domain industry requires the detailed specifications for sharing and exchanging building information models throughout the design, construction, and operation phases. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) Model View Definitions (MVDs) specify required information for exchanges of building model data among building project experts. The data involves the identification of model semantics shared by two or more applications. However, since no robust standard for defining building semantics and requirements for data exchange has been agreed upon, information embedded in domain-specific MVDs are generated separately and are vague in scope, which results in a lack of consistency. In addition, the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) that includes exchange specifications needed for each exchange process of a product model is manually defined in a paper-based document. Because there is no clear logical link between the units of information in the exchange requirements of an IDM, and those of MVDs, the mapping that translates requirements of an IDM into ones of an MVD is open to various interpretation, without semantic and logical consistency. Such challenges might result in redundant requirements and rules for data exchange that are not supposed to be handled in the process of MVDs. To ameliorate this situation, this research proposes the new approach of formalizing domain knowledge and defining accurate data modules for model views. To achieve this goal, the authors employed ontological principles for generating an IDM for the precast concrete domain and for linking its MVD with formal information models. The formalized structure of domain knowledge is expected to support defining explicit data modules and developing manageable relationships among entities using semantic reasoning so that domain professionals and software vendors can identify the intents of the requirements of mapped MVDs and keep track of mapping problems. Moreover, to integrate IDM and MVD development processes, the ontology-based IDM is parsed and translated from OWL/XML to mvdXML, which automatically generates MVD documentation in the IfcDoc tool.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe an approach to translating the written content of the Korean Building Act into a computer-executable format for the purpose of evaluating building permit requirements. Among the various applications of building information modeling (BIM), we focus on automated design assessment and its rule-making process, which has been performed by both architects and software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach, which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism (KBimLogic) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into computer-executable code (KBimCode) is a software-independent approach that separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district, permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this approach has been demonstrated by each database and a GUI-based application named KBimLogic, for generating KBimCode. The KBimCode, which contains a set of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be imported into our code-checking software (KBimAssess) using a specific file format.},

  abstract = {During the design and construction phases of building projects, domain experts iteratively exchange building information models. One of their goals is to ensure that the requirements and objectives of a proposed project are satisfied. In addition, most building information modeling software currently implements heterogeneous mapping processes in their IFC interfaces that bind their native models to the IFC format. However, such exchanges frequently do not realize intended geometric transformations, project requirements, and required syntactic and semantic conditions in building model data, exacerbating the problem of model integrity and resulting in expensive changes during the construction and operation phases. These problematic issues have been addressed by the development of solid frameworks for validating a building design. This paper surveys six currently available applications for validating building design data and identifies their strengths and weaknesses: The Express Engine's EXPRESSO, the JDSAI™, the EXPRESS Data Manager™, the IFC server ActiveX Component, the IfcDoc, and the Solibri Model Checker®. We also structured the validation processes into three types of tasks: 1) a syntax check of the assurance of compliance with the IFC schema defined by the EXPRESS language, 2) semantic and syntactic assessment in terms of conformity to model view definitions, which consist of concept modularizations, and 3) the validation of design programming requirements that evaluates regulations, project criteria, owner requirements, and functional performance. The purpose of this survey, based on available software that supports the validation of building model data for these three types of interoperability issues, is to integrate diverse checking approaches, as a basis for improving what are now widely distributed efforts.},

BIM has established itself as a field of research in (and beyond) scientific communities interested in information technologies in construction. Interestingly, the contours of BIM as a scientific field are still not clearly identified. Several studies have recently tried to analyze different aspects of this issue, without providing a systematic and comprehensive methodological approach to accurately define the major themes and clusters of the BIM domain. This paper uses a systematic literature review approach to map the BIM research themes and clusters over ten years of scientific publications. 1244 articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2016 were selected and the associated metadata analyzed in order to highlight co-occurrences in author’s keywords. It appears that a few “big players” dominate the keywords, while most of the keywords used by authors are much less cited. Seven core clusters are identified using modularity optimization techniques: industry foundation classes, information technology, facility management, building, collaboration, computer aided design, and laser scanning.},

This leads to a rule set that is brittle, complicated, difficult to understand, and obscures the central point of a given normative provision. Moreover, assessing compliance, to any degree, in the absence of complete information about a building, down to the smallest detail, is very limited in a purely deductive setting in which nothing can be assumed.

  abstract = {Underground utility incidents, such as utility conflicts and utility strikes, result in time and cost overruns in construction projects, property damages, environmental pollution, personnel injuries, and fatalities. A main cause of recurrent utility incidents is the noncompliance with the spatial configurations between utilities and their surroundings. Utility specifications usually contain textual descriptions of the spatial configurations. However, detection of spatial defects, according to the textual descriptions, is difficult and time consuming. This deficiency is because of the lack of spatial cognition in many rule-checking systems to process massive amounts of data. This study aims to automate utility compliance checking by integrating natural language processing (NLP) and spatial reasoning. NLP algorithm translates the textual descriptions of spatial configurations into computer-processable spatial rules. Spatial reasoning executes the extracted spatial rules following a logical order in a geographical information system (GIS) to identify noncompliance. The intellectual contribution of this study is twofold. First, complex spatial rules are retrieved automatically from textual data with their hierarchies classified, which provides the inputs and indicates the sequence of rule execution in spatial reasoning. Second, semantic spatial relations are modeled on the basis of their metric and topological implications, enabling the automatic execution of multiple spatial rules. Experiments were conducted to test this framework. The average precision, recall, and combination of the two (F-measure) achieved by the NLP algorithm for extracting spatial rules are 87.88\%, 79.09\%, and 83.25\%, respectively. In addition, the spatial reasoning mechanism also was found to be a powerful tool for compliance checking under various scenarios.},

In model transformation, the population of attributes on the target side constitutes the last step of the conversion process that carries over that part of the input which is often perceived as the most valuable actual information. We are employing a graph-based model transformation approach to convert building information models into geospatial city models. In this paper, we are reporting on different types of transformation rules to populate the attributes on CityGML side using information extracted from the IFC data. We document the various ways how attribute values can be stored in IFC and CityGML respectively and identify patterns that bridge these endpoints in the conversion process. These patterns lead to a set of prototypical graph transformation rules which have been applied to a range of building projects. The novel graph-based approach to IFC-to-CityGML conversion implicates an intuitive visual representation of these rules. This work can also serve as a starting point to convert IFC data to other formats or to populate CityGML from other data sources.},

Our novel framework addresses these challenges by integrating a specialised geometry database, built-in spatial optimisations, and support for real arithmetic solving.

  abstract = {Many cross-knowledge domain tasks involving various professional backgrounds have been transferred from construction sites to factories in modular construction (MC). In MC, forming optimal work packages which can handle the complexity of product breakdown structures and dynamic project progress is critical for task planning and execution. However, forming MC work packages is time-consuming and ineffective because it is performed manually while not adequately considering domain knowledge. To address the problem, this study proposes a dynamic ontology-based mapping (DOM) approach to automatically generate semantic-enriched work packages. For this purpose, ontologies of MC products, topology, and tasks are established to incorporate domain knowledge. Then, a customized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for mapping products to tasks and a weighted hierarchical clustering model for grouping dynamic tasks into work packages are developed. The effectiveness of the DOM approach is tested in an MC case project and controlled experiments. The results demonstrate that the DOM approach can significantly increase the accuracy and efficiency of the dynamic work packaging process while reducing planning time compared to conventional methods, which thus improve the collaborative management and performance of MC projects.}

Our framework is based on the declarative Answer Set Programming (ASP) logic programming language that we extend to support optimised geometric and spatial reasoning. We address three key challenges in formalising building codes: (1) Ambiguity and qualitative aspects of modern performance-based building codes, e.g. "Essential information on wayfinding must be easy to see, read and understand (BR15)"; "There shall be no direct line of sight between an access route and a WC (NZBC-G1)". Our framework supports integrated layers of abstraction (in the context of ontologies and knowledge engineering) in order to ground how behavioural and human-centred terms such as "easy to see" and "access route" are ultimately defined based on results from cognitive psychology and declarative spatial reasoning. (2) Managing a relatively large code base that can support maintainability, extensibility, traceability, and transparency, i.e. a particular code definition can be easily traced back to research literature used for its formalisation, and indeed multiple alternative definitions can be implemented and checked simultaneously. (3) Keeping the computational runtime efficient for practical applications, despite processing a large number of codes and a large size of real-world building models. We present empirical results (including real building models from New Zealand) to demonstrate that formalised codes definitions can focus exclusively on the semantics without mixing in "tricks" to make them computationally faster for handling a large-scale BIM, which is often at the cost of clarity and code base maintainability, etc. Thus, we leverage the declarative character of ASP to achieve a total separation of (a) semantic definition from (b) computational runtime efficiency of conformance checking.},

With the development of semantic web technology, ontology can be used to represent code information and check the code automatically. However, code ontology is established manually by researchers who have sufficient domain knowledge, in which it is easy to cause poor hierarchical structure of classes. It is also possible for code ontology not being suitable for compliance check. This paper proposes a semiautomatic construction method of railway code ontology based on ifcOWL. The railway code ontology is developed by converting ifcOWL which extends semantic information of railway code. This method can ensure the completeness of the hierarchical relationship of the classes in code ontology with good scalability, which makes use of taxonomy in ifcOWL. The establishment of ontology is divided into two processes with low coupling, namely, extension and conversion, which reduces the domain knowledge requirements of the researchers. Finally, a practical specification is selected to generate a code ontology that achieves some clauses checking.},

Explicit semantic analysis (ESA) is a method that automatically extracts concept-based features from human knowledge repositories for semantic retrieval. This avoids the requirement of constructing and maintaining an explicitly formalized ontology. However, since domain-specific knowledge repositories are relatively small, the available terminologies are insufficient and concepts have coarse granularity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ESA method for product model retrieval in construction industry. The major enhancements for the original ESA method consist of two parts. First, a novel concept expansion algorithm is proposed to solve the problem caused by insufficient terminologies. Second, a reranking algorithm is developed to solve the problem caused by coarse granularity of concepts. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of product model retrieval and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also applicable to product retrieval in other engineering domain if a specific knowledge repository is provided in that domain.},

Furthermore, conventional BIM models do not contain all the required information for automatic QTO and the results do not follow the descriptive rules in the standard method of measurement (SMM). This paper presents a new knowledge model-based framework that incorporates the semantic information and SMM rules in BIM for automatic code-compliant QTO. It begins with domain knowledge modeling, taking into consideration QTO-related information, semantic QTO entities and relationships, and SMM logic formulation. Subsequently, linguistic-based approaches are developed to automatically audit the BIM model integrity for QTO purposes, with QTO algorithms developed and used in a case study for demonstration. The results indicate that the proposed new framework automatically identifies the semantic errors in BIM models and obtains code-compliant quantities.}

  abstract = {In AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Owner-operated) industry information are mainly defined and exchanged in natural language through textual files and documents. On the contrary, a Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach requires machine processable data and information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows to process textual information into structured format. About BIM in AECO industry, and NLP in different sectors, several literature reviews have been conducted. However, none of them highlighted the possible connections between the two topics. This study provides a scientometric analysis aiming to investigate possible combined applications of BIM and NLP. A quantitative literature review approach is employed, using data visualization and science mapping applied on bibliometric meta-data. The performed analysis uncovered possible directions for further research on NLP and BIM combined applications in AECO sector. Most active authors, key research patterns, and institutional affiliations are identified. The main applications areas of a combined NLP and BIM approach in AECO are: Information Retrieval and Information Enrichment of BIM models, Automatic Compliance Checking, and Safety and Risk Management. The keywords pattern analysis highlighted the main tools which allows to link Semantic BIM and NLP methods and technologies, i.e. Ontology and Machine Learning algorithms. The scientometric analysis also reveals a gap related to the Preliminary design and Requirement definition phases, highlighting a possible research area not covered by the Academia as of now.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop an ontology-based framework for energy management in buildings. We divide the functional architecture of a building energy management system into three interconnected modules that include building management system (BMS), benchmarking (BMK), and evaluation \&amp; control (ENC) modules. The BMS module is responsible for measuring several useful environmental parameters, as well as real-time energy consumption of the building. The BMK module provides the necessary information required to understand the context and cause of building energy efficiency or inefficiency, and also the information which can further differentiate normal and abnormal energy consumption in different scenarios. The ENC module evaluates all the information coming from BMS and BMK modules, the information is contextualized, and finally the cause of energy inefficiency/abnormality and mitigating control actions are determined. Methodology to design appropriate ontology and inference rules for various modules is also discussed. With the help of actual data obtained from three different rooms in a commercial building in Singapore, a case study is developed to demonstrate the application and advantages of the proposed framework. By mitigating the appropriate cause of abnormal inefficiency, we can achieve 5.7\%, 11.8\% and 8.7\% energy savings in Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3 respectively, while creating minimum inconvenience for the users.},

Available examples are mostly experimental, limited in scope, and without an obvious transfer to practice. Yet, a substantial number of academics and practitioners envision that the use of big data will have a significant impact on how decisions are made in the building design process, providing designers with an unprecedented amount of exceptionally detailed data on buildings and their occupants that is redefining what can be observed, modeled, simulated, predicted and measured in the industry. We first review the main concepts and technologies that shape this technological phenomenon, and then, based on the survey of around 100 cases of applications of big data and machine learning throughout all phases of building design we identify 12 clusters of applications where the technology seems to be more disruptive. The discussion then focuses on the transformative impacts of the technology on three niches where further research is more urgently needed: 1) understanding the design problem; 2) simulating and predicting the holistic performance of the design solution; 3) evaluating integrally and continuously the design product during its complete lifecycle.},

Safety checking which identifies hazards before they occur is a core process of safety management on construction sites. However, the traditional construction safety checking which is operated by the experienced manager is manual and time-consuming. In order to integrate new technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for construction safety checking i.e. CSCOntology (Construction Safety Checking Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using an ontology language, OWL for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation provisions are represented with a rule language, SWRL. Then the construction safety checking processes are implemented in the JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform by transforming OWL knowledge into JESS facts, and SWRL constraints into JESS rules. A real-world example has been demonstrated in Protégé 3.4 beta to show the proposed safety checking process, according to the regulation examples taken from “29 CFR 1926 OSHA Construction Industry Regulations”.},

  abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted for representing and exchanging building data across disciplines during building design and construction. However, BIM's use in the building operation phase is limited. With the increasing deployment of low-cost sensors and meters, as well as affordable digital storage and computing technologies, growing volumes of data have been collected from buildings, their energy services systems, and occupants. Such data are crucial to help decision makers understand what, how, and when energy is consumed in buildings—a critical step to improving building performance for energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience. However, practical analyses and use of the collected data are very limited due to various reasons, including poor data quality, ad-hoc representation of data, and lack of data science skills. To unlock value from building data, there is a strong need for a toolchain to curate and represent building information and performance data in common standardized terminologies and schemas, to enable interoperability between tools and applications. This study selected and reviewed 24 data tools based on common use cases of data across the building life cycle, from design to construction, commissioning, operation, and retrofits. The selected data tools are grouped into three categories: (1) data dictionary or terminology, (2) data ontology and schemas, and (3) data platforms. The data are grouped into ten typologies covering most types of data collected in buildings. This study resulted in five main findings: (1) most data representation tools can represent their intended data typologies well, such as Green Button for smart meter data and Brick schema for metadata of sensors in buildings and HVAC systems, but none of the tools cover all ten types of data; (2) there is a need for data schemas to represent the basis of design data and metadata of occupant data; (3) standard terminologies such as those defined in BEDES are only adopted in a few data tools; (4) integrating data across various stages in the building life cycle remains a challenge; and (5) most data tools were developed and maintained by different parties for different purposes, their flexibility and interoperability can be improved to support broader use cases. Finally, recommendations for future research on building data tools are provided for the data and buildings community based on the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.}

As a case in point, this paper reports on experiences gained while modeling ̄zmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code (IMHZcode). First, IMHZcode was analysed to understand the various types of information contained in it in order to develop a comprehensive building code model. The rules were classified according to their formalizability and self-containedness. Then, existing modeling approaches were evaluated to find the most convenient method that meets the needs for modeling IMHZcode. A key criterion used in this evaluation was ease of maintenance by non-programmers. The paper concludes with an illustrative example of the selected methodology's application within the context of IMHZcode.},

  abstract = {In the past, building information modeling (BIM) in general and building performance simulation (BPS) in particular have developed and deployed fairly detailed representations of building geometry, fabric, construction, and technology. Relatively less attention has been paid to the representations of building users. Thereby, one of the key challenges concerns the matching between the nature and level of building-related performance queries on the one hand and the required or appropriate resolution of applied occupant models. This paper addressed this challenge via a two-fold path: A “top-down” path examines the ontological scope of comprehensive, theory-driven representations of building occupants. Such representations could be presumably condensed so as to match the informational requirements of specific performance queries. On the other hand, a “bottom-up” path involves the reverse-engineering of typical building performance simulation tools, focusing thereby on the implicit schema rooted in the tool's input modalities vis-à-vis occupant information. The top-down path can inform the definition of a common schema for occupant-related information. The bottom-up reverse-engineering can provide a reality check in view of the ontological depth of common occupant representations in analysis tools. The pursuit of these paths is suggested to highlight a gap between behavioral domain knowledge and default occupant representation in BIM and the analysis of this gap can facilitate the derivation of related ontologies.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, the use of information management systems in the building data processing led to radical changes to the methods of data production, documentation and archiving. In particular, the possibilities, given by these information systems, to visualize the 3D model and to formulate queries have placed the question of the information sharing in digital format. The integration of information systems represents an efficient solution for defining smart, sustainable and resilient projects, such as conservation and restoration processes, giving the possibilities to combine heterogeneous data. GIS provides a robust data storage system, a definition of topological and semantic relationships and spatial queries. 3D GIS makes possible the creation of three-dimensional model in a geospatial context. To promote the interoperability of GIS data, the present research aims first to analyse methods of conversion in CityGML and IndoorGML model, defining an ontological domain. This has led to the creation of a new enriched model, based on connections among the different elements of the urban model in GIS environment, and to the possibility to formulate queries based on these relations. The second step consists in collecting all data translated into a specific format that fill a graph database in a semantic web environment, while maintaining those relationships. The semantic web technology represents an efficient tool of interoperability that leaves open the possibility to import BIM data in the same graph database and to join both GIS and BIM models.

  abstract = {Building designs in countries such as the United Kingdom are currently checked manually against a frequently changing and increasingly complex set of building regulations. This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for England and Wales.},

  abstract = {The activities of briefing (stating problems to be solved) and designing (instantiating solutions) are intimately interlinked – both parts of the same process to develop and procure a product which satisfies one or more needs. There is an on-going “conversation” between problem (requirement) definition and design proposal in which acceptable proposals progressively add to, and refine, the definition of the whole solution while at the same time potentially generating further problems to be resolved. At any point in time through this process, the developed whole solution is composed of partial solutions which form the context against which further problem statements are made. These problem statements are indicators for a future desired state of the whole solution. The design briefing process also can be seen as starting before professional designers are involved and continues after they complete their project contribution, so retaining design intentions alongside solutions is valuable for the on- going use of a designed product. With these ideas as background, this paper investigates the hypothesis that data for briefing and design can be usefully correlated within integrated building information data models. Several extensions are proposed to the IFC data schema that formalise the way requirements can be modelled. It is then shown how rule-based checking of solutions can be implemented against requirements defined in this way.},

  abstract = {The international construction industry is in a state of change with regard to how projects are defined, described, built and managed using Building Information Modelling (BIM) as the foundation. This change has created some confusion in the market as different public and private initiatives have emerged with various guidance regarding the implementation of robust digital practices. Moreover, the digital shift has been complicated by the fact that different organisations faced the global trend towards BIM at a different stage of their digitisation journey. Currently, approaches to managing digital information are already established and widely applied in many organisations. This has created adverse implications for the industry as no single uniform approach is applied to make the flow of information universally sustained so that all actors, regardless of their particular context, can leverage the benefits of digitisation. To address this issue, European and International standardisation bodies (CEN, ISO) have set up technical committees solely responsible for the development of a set of standards that specify methodologies to define, describe, exchange, monitor, record and securely handle all data used within the construction sector. Furthermore, International industry organisations such as buildingSMART International, FIEC (European Construction Industry Federation), CPE (Construction Product Europe) etc. are also involved with this standardization work. This creates a community of international stakeholders who bring expertise to the process and help for the co-creation and implementation of standards across the global construction industry. Due to the novelty of this standardisation work, however, there is still some confusion in the market regarding issues such as what is the standard way to define and structure construction object data for construction works and building services in the built environment in order to make it suitable for digital use. ‘A construction object’ in the context of this document can be defined as object of interest in the context of construction process (ISO 12006-2:2015). Therefore, ‘a construction object’ can be used to denominate product, system, assembly, space, building, etc  	Where does construction object data come from?

The subjective nature of evaluating bridge conditions and bridge deterioration is one of the main factors that influences bridge maintenance, repair, and replacement (MR\&R) decisions. This study presents a stochastic fuzzy logic decision support integrated with a bridge information management system (BrIMS) to forecast bridge deteriorations and prioritize maintenance, repair, and replacement (MR\&R) decisions at the conceptual design stage. The proposed system considers numerous factors that influence the prioritization of bridge MR\&R decision making including complex time-dependent gamma shock models. A parametric analysis is conducted in order to quantify the degree of accuracy of the system. Implementation of the system platform demonstrated the viability of integrating BrIMS with fuzzy-logic deterioration forecast techniques at the conceptual stage of bridge design. The proposed system is validated through a case study and found to be in agreement with actual bridge deterioration results with a percentage difference of approximately 10 - 15 \%. Besides that, the integrated platform may be utilized as a forecasting tool that is capable of predicting and prioritizing MR\&R decisions to components for diverse bridge design alternatives.},

A typical shortcoming of performance testing is the difficulty of linking a failing test to a faulty or underperforming component. Furthermore, a failing test can also be linked to a wrongly configured performance test. In this paper, we present Building Metadata Performance Testing (BuMPeT), a method that addresses this shortcoming by using building metadata models to extend performance testing with fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) capabilities. We present four different procedures that apply BuMPeT to different data sources and components. We have applied the proposed method to a case study building, located in Denmark, to test its capacity and benefits. Additionally, we use two real case scenarios to showcase examples of failing performance tests in the building, as well as discovery of causes of underperformance. Finally, to examine the limits to the benefits of the applied procedure, a detailed elaboration of a hypothetical scenario is presented. Our findings demonstrate that the method has potential and it can serve to increase the energy efficiency of a wide range of buildings.},

The purpose of this paper is to extend and validate that methodology with an open standard approach. A subset of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema related to performance assessment and maintenance procedures is mapped into a relational database. The database supports the integration between BIM models and facilities information systems. Case studies including healthcare buildings test the database and a new application. The results contribute to the BIM adoption in the FM domain. Also, the studied and validated IFC schema subset can be considered as a contribution to the Model View Definition for FM.},

To ease the transition towards creating digital twins for existing constructions, this work presents a method for automated segmentation of bridge point clouds based on images using convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, semantic segmentation is used for labelling the photographs captured during laser scanning. The classifications masks of this image-based approach are then projected back into 3D, resulting in a labelled point cloud ready for further processing and building component reconstruction.},

This paper presents research conducted at the University of Porto that has resulted in an original method and a software application for the automated code-checking of building water network designs. Although the methods are based on the main Portuguese regulations, they may be adapted to other countries. The paper presents a review of the core principles behind BIM-based automated code-checking, and discusses the role of the IFC model as a viable format for the exchange of data in a code-checking system, as well as current international automated code-checking initiatives. The authors conclude that automated code-checking procedures can be feasibly implemented in the short term in some domains, and that they may provide a significant incentive towards widespread BIM adoption.},

The first two are related to standalone geometry descriptions, i.e. one for RDF-based geometry schemas with as root object property the omg:hasComplexGeometryDescription and one for existing geometry schemas that can be represented using RDF literals with as root datatype property omg:hasSimpleGeometryDescription. This first series of properties (e.g. fog:asGltf) is then splitted per version of the geometry schema (e.g. fog:asGltf\_v2.0), which are again splitted further if the geometry format consists of different kind of files (e.g. fog:asGltf\_v2.0-glb). The last taxonomy of properties extends the OMG datatype property omg:hasReferencedGeometryId and allows to define a geometry description as part of a larger geometry description, by mentioning the ID of the geometry object related to the geometry schema used. If a geometry schema contains multiple types of IDs, a distinction is made by defining more specific subproperties (e.g. fog:hasRevitId-element).},

The existing IFC-to-RDF converter tool, converts IFC into ifcOWL-based Abox graphs which are rather complex and difficult to implement in software applications. The IFC-to-LBD converter presented, is necessary to transform IFC building models into RDF Abox graphs structured according the new LBD ontologies. An output graph contains the relevant information of the IFC building model related to building topology, building elements classification and building-related properties. Additionally, the graph structure becomes more concise (minimum 83 \% less triples) and significantly easier to query compared to the output of the ifcOWL-based IFC-to-RDF converter.},

  abstract = {The notion of advancing levels of adequate regulatory compliance within the domain of construction and engineering is by no means a new phenomenon. An extensive degree of effort has over a number of decades previously focused on semi/fully automating design checking against regulatory building codes. After experiencing somewhat of a dip in popularity within academia, this research topic is once again of great interest due to the on-going adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the construction domain among other drivers like frequent updates to building regulatory documents particularly in relation to sustainability related issues like energy efficiency of buildings. This interest will only increase as we witness further widespread adoption of this new BIM paradigm across until now untouched disciplines. Unfortunately design checking within the remit of BIM still faces major problems with respect to national and local regulations as no sustainably sensible or scalable method has yet been implemented to ensure compliance rules are consistent with current legislation within these contexts. This work questions a suitable representational data format for UK construction and engineering regulations focusing on machine processable formats built entirely on open data standards which can then set the basis for addressing the aforementioned issues. We compare two existing legislation data models, namely the Crown Legislation Markup Language (CLML) and Akoma Ntoso, whilst in the process grading each on its suitability for most accurately accommodating and expressing the domain and profession specific nature of typical building regulations. The study conclusions indicate that the design, management and current availability of the CLML has resulted in a scenario where barriers exist to widespread adoption, this includes building out community in support of the language. Akoma Ntoso on the other hand has focused on building community around the proposed standard. This increases the likelihood of phased organisational transition towards the standard for achieving improved representational data modelling.},

With specific focus on engineering of ontologies from a legislative perspective, current solutions leave many questions relating to best practice unanswered and provide minimal guidance to how, as engineers, we can accurately develop accurate, standards compliant ontological manifestations of legal documentation. We present our research in the form of a process framework for semi-automated ontology construction using building regulations as an example scenario. This work will appeal to engineers familiar with the preceding technicalities as well as newcomers to ontology engineering who are challenged with alternative manifestations of legal documents within the AEC domain. The objective therefore is to further enable improved uptake and cultural embracement of open government data using the platform provided by linked data paradigm for better communication of AEC regulations},

Rather than simply provide training for proprietary software, university BIM education could support innovation through the development of standardized OpenBIM tools, data and processes, supporting students to analyse their own models and learn from BIM rather than simply learn howto BIM. This paper presents a family of courses, wherein; (1) postgraduate students in the autumn, develop OpenBIM tools and processes, that are used in the spring to provide rule checking on (2) the BIM modelling for an undergraduate course and (3) the design models of a post graduate multidisciplinary course. Feedback from the tools is integrated into the students’ personalized course homepages. An open web-based platform is proposed where students in the design and modelling courses receive feedback on their BIM from tools developed in the BIM tool and analysis course.},

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a key enabler to support integration of building data within the buildings life cycle (BLC). LD can therefore provide better access and more semantically useful querying of BIM data. The integration of BIM into the geospatial domain provides much needed contextual information about the building and its surroundings, and can support geospatial querying over BIM data. Creating GeoSPARQL queries for users who are non experts in semantic web technologies can be a challenge. In this paper we present a visualization tool built upon HTML5 and WebGL technologies that supports queries over linked data without the need to understand the resulting SPARQL queries. The interactive web interface can be quickly extended to support new use cases, for example, related to 3D geometries. The paper discusses the underlying data management, the methodology for uplifting several open data sources into Resource Description Framework (RDF), and the front-end implementation tested over a sample use case. Finally some discussion and future work is given, with a focus on how this tool can potentially support BIM integration.},

  abstract = {Geometric data plays a central role in the geospatial domain, architectural design and construction industry. For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective challenges.},

Regarding the construction and facility management domains, several IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) based ontologies have been developed, such as IfcOWL.

In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the IFC model into OWL which leverages from all modelling constraints required by the object-oriented structure of IFC schema. Therefore, we do not only present a syntactic but also a semantic adaptation of the IFC model. Our model takes into consideration the meaning of entities, relationships, properties and attributes defined by the IFC standard. Our approach presents several advantages compared to other initiatives such as the optimization of query execution time. Every advantage is defended by means of practical examples and benchmarks.},

Preliminary results allow to automatically evaluate formally expressed compliance rules for underground objects in a 3D city model, that will considerably ease the task of professionals of the field.},

  abstract = {This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.},

In recent years, simulation platforms have been employed to study ITS applications, mostly focusing on traffic-related simulations. Despite several research studies on ITS applications and simulation platforms, formal semantic descriptions of intelligent transportation systems have not been addressed yet. In this paper, a semantic model describing intelligent transportation systems for roads is proposed. The semantic model is devised to provide a basis for designing ITS simulation platforms. Building upon the semantic model, an extension to an open building information modeling (BIM) standard, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema, is presented. The IFC schema extension is verified and validated using a BIM-based simulation scenario of ITS for roads. It is shown that the proposed IFC-compliant description of ITS for roads provides a formal basis for generating BIM-based simulations and hence facilitates ITS infrastructure modeling in BIM projects. It is concluded that the present work represents a cornerstone for designing BIM-based ITS simulation platforms.

  abstract = {The reliable infrastructure of building automation (BA) systems forms the foundation of smart environments and energy systems in our building towards increasing occupant comfort and safety while reducing the ecological footprint of buildings. This is achieved through the processing of data points collected from sensors and the control of installed actuators, and increasingly incorporates machine learning components. However, engineering of BA systems is intricately linked with the planning, installation, (pre-)commissioning, and operation of building services such as HVAC, and it requires an extensive amount of manual coordination which is often prone to errors, many of which are only detected late in the lifecycle and tends to lose transparency in data provenance. To address this, we propose the application of DevOps, a highly successful paradigm in the field of software engineering, to BA engineering process coordination. In addition, the possibility of using semantic data to develop artifacts such as requirements, construction, and devices of BA systems opens up the avenue of achieving continuous verification of the system as it is built and commissioned. Concretely, we propose a novel approach that integrates a semantic reasoner using the machine-understandable data of the building along with interactions facilitated by Web of Thing Thing Description to the DevOps workflow. The proposed approach is expected to ameliorate limitations of existing workflow management methods and thus provide transparency in the data provenance to gain trust for data-driven AI applications for BA.},

This paper describes clause classification using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) method in natural language processing. Seven risk categories are determined from a literature review, including payment, temporal, procedure, safety, role and responsibility, definition, and reference. Using 2807 clauses from 56 construction specifications, the BERT-based clause classification model returns noticeable performances with 0.889 accuracy for validation and a 0.934 F1 score on testing. The model is evaluated by comparing the clause classification performance with other machine learning methods, including the support vector machine and a simple deep neural network, and shows dominant performance on every risk category. Practitioners in the construction industry are the primary beneficiaries of the research as the model will contribute to improving the construction specification review process and risk management during construction projects.}

As the damage to the environment is rapidly growing, the criticism towards the linear economy model is increasing. Circular Economy is perceived as an environmentally friendly alternative. However, Circular Economy implementation in the industry is still in its infancy. Researchers agree that the early design phase plays a signiϐicant role in building circularity, but early-stage circularity assessment is not a common practice. Therefore, this paper investigates the technical needs for early circularity assessment and proposes a novel assessment framework relying on Semantic Web and Linked Building Data technologies. A new Building Circularity Assessment Ontology "BCAO" is proposed to structure the scattered heterogenous manufacturer product data needed for the assessment. The ontology and the application framework are evaluated in a use case that reveals the potential in guiding the design decisions to more circular alternatives.},

In the paper requirements to an IFC query language are summarized with the focus on the compliance and harmonization with data definition and data manipulation languages which generally are the parts of a common data access interface. As a result of the study, the IFC query language was proposed and formalized. Using EXPRESS constructs and JSON structures, the language allows to specify complex predicative queries on object collections and recursive traversing queries on object networks. Explanatory examples of typical IFC queries are provided to illustrate the proposed language and prove its advantages.},

This assessment was conducted by experiments that imported and exported structural models and structural elements through a non-proprietarz standard for bim mod­els (ifc- industry foundation classes). The experiments were conducted twice, with a five year gap from each other, so the evolution of the interoperability could be assessed as well. The results showed that some special characteristics must be considered in order to achieve efficient interoperability for cast-in-place concrete structures – these structures are monolithic and they have reinforcement steel bars that need detailing. Also, the research showed that in the five-year gap there were evolutions in interoperability, like in object identifiers, which had a considerable improvement. However, some of the major problems remain, such as overlapping of structural parts.},

Data in these domains is increasing at a rate quicker than the increase in main memory and computation power of a single machine. Recent efforts in OWL reasoning algorithms lead to the decrease in classification time from several hours to a few seconds even for large ontologies like SNOMED CT. This is especially true for ontologies in the description logic EL+ (a fragment of the OWL 2 EL profile). Reasoners such as Pellet, Hermit, ELK etc. make an assumption that the ontology would fit in the main memory, which is unreasonable given projected increase in data volumes. Increase in the data volume also necessitates an increase in the computation power. This lead us to the use of a distributed system, so that memory and computation requirements can be spread across machines.

  abstract = {Municipalities invest a lot of time and person-hours into manual building permit checks. With the increase in computational power and the use of Building Information Models (BIM) in the building design life cycle, several municipalities are investing in automating these checks using BIM and geo-data sets. However, few examples exist of tools effectively using geo-information with BIM. In order to address this gap, a project was developed with the municipality of Rotterdam (NL). In a previous phase, a tool was implemented, able to analyse the BIM data to extract the needed information for a few representative regulations. In order to extend and improve the previously developed tool, a web-based interface is now implemented and geo-data sets are integrated to the process allowing more powerful GeoBIM analysis. Three checks using both BIM and GIS data were implemented and tested: (i) The parcel limit check evaluates if the building's footprint derived from BIM falls within the parcel limit provided from the municipalities' parcel data sets. (ii) The height check evaluates the maximum building's relative height to the road's height. Finally, (iii) the road overhang check detects neighbouring roads to the parcel and evaluates the admissible overhang over that road. This paper presents these developments, including the type of input data that is needed for the checks, the tools for the three new GeoBIM checks (parcel limit check, height check, road overhang check) and the implementation in the web-based tool. © 2022 N.

The drawback of most exist- ing business rule approaches is the lack of standardization and interoperability. The lack of service-orientation and re- mote accessibility of business rule engines makes it hard to use business rules in distributed environments. This paper contributes the design and implementation of VIDRE (Vi- enna Distributed Rules Engine), a service-oriented business rule engine based on RuleML. VIDRE enables enterprise applications to access business rules as easy as accessing a database, by exposing rules as Web services. VIDRE uses RuleML as an interlingua to represent facts, rules, and queries. One of the main contributions of the VIDRE ap- proach is the ability to distribute rules and facts across var- ious rule engines, therefore, enabling powerful ways of sep- arating and executing business rules within intra- and in- terorganizational boundaries.}

  abstract = {Automation of the code compliance checking has been explored extensively, particularly in recent years with the emergence of building information modelling (BIM). Still, automated code compliance checking has not yet been fully realized, as there is no standardized method for rule interpretation and building model preparation for code compliance. Manual verification of design code compliance, meanwhile, requires significant effort and time and is error-prone, while uncertainty and inconsistency in assessment lead to delays in the construction process. In this paper, the development of a prototype to automate municipal bylaw and wall framing code compliance checking for residential building is presented. The building rules have been classified into three groups based on the complexity involved in translation into computer-readable format and complexity in retrieving the required information, and they are represented based on building objects, which makes the regulations easier to understand and assists in translating the regulations into a computer-readable format. By creating a model view based on the required element's parameters extracted from a model for checking purposes, the prototype application offers automated code compliance checking functionality to validate designs based on building code requirements and construction engineering specifications. The implementation of the prototype and its benefits compared to manual checking is demonstrated.},

Also, reducing commissioning lead-time allows fast operation and more significant financial results. However, the on-site procedures of inspection and tests are mostly still managed by conventional ways paper-work-based, although some applications based on information technologies (e.g., tablets and PDF files) have already started to bring digital solutions to the field, that is not enough. Lacking interoperability is a persistent issue that inhibits process-oriented management. From this, CERTI Foundation, a Centres of Reference in Innovative Technologies, and an O\&G Company from Brazil deployed a research and technological development project to implement a solution that allows middle-users to model and deploy on-site commissioning process-task-based. Also, workers and inspectors can receive and record on mobile devices the activities information. An Information Delivery Manual (IDM), ISO/DIS 29481-1 (2014), is performed to capture the current business process integrating all stakeholders (e.g., O\&G company, system providers, and new system developers). The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) ISO 16739:2018 is adopted as a neutral language and open data format to collaborate data between the new system developed for the owner O\&G company and their suppliers to achieve high agility supply chains. An ifcJSON-4 version in sync with IFC EXPRESS Schema was developed to extend IFC to O\&G Commissioning management information. It is totally queryable (CRUD operations) via REST API, allowing clients to access the exact information of interest. We have then translated the IFC data model into RDF, and we are currently working on semantic enrichment of the data in order to achieve new levels of queryable data and intelligent automatic inferences. This work presents the latest data schemas developed for the O\&G sector and the proof of concepts conducted. Finally, the discussions lead to some conclusions as the commissioning processes need to be faster while maintaining security for workers, and the first step is standardising its information. Nothing is better than using neutral and universal formats, and IFC fits to achieve this. The second step is making the information available to end-users, and REST APIs to query IFC data do the work. The third step is to enrich the data model semantically, and again IFC might provide a shortcut to that by ifcOWL. We need then to continue the enrichment process by diving deeper into semantics and linked data in order to enable automatic inferences capability. The project's future directions are concerning the creation of a semantic web data model, which will be the basis for using AI in conjunction with a high-capacity data bus, to automatically detect bottlenecks in the commissioning process.},

  abstract = {As the mounting demand for building new residential and commercial units strikes the record, significant pressure from stakeholders investing in the construction industry has increasingly been requiring the government authorities to issue the construction permit in a timely manner. However, the architectural and engineering design review process is still mostly a time-consuming manual procedure. It involves assessing a design against codes and standards requirements to validate the accuracy and quality of the design and detecting errors before manufacturing and fabrication commences. Building design provisions are generally in the form of texts, charts, tables, and mathematical expressions. These regulations and guidelines usually have legal status. Thus, the computerization of this process represents a real challenge to the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides a platform for developing a virtual permitting process to improve the efficacy of issuing building permits by the authorities. This chapter reviews recent advancements in virtual permitting using BIM. Also, it presents data collected about the construction permitting process from Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) plan reviewers, architects, engineers, and general contractors in the state of Florida. The primary goal is to tackle the problem by using the available data and technology to develop a BIM-driven Virtual Permitting System (VPS) to achieve design accuracy and permitting efficiency. The potential integration of VPS with blockchain will be discussed, along with benefits and limitations.},

They are often referred to as ‘Black Box’ or ‘Gray Box’ approaches.This research offers a new comprehensive framework that reduces the limitations of the cited methods.Building regulations, for instance, are legal documents transcribed and approved by professionals tobe interpreted and applied by people. They are hardly as precise as formal logic. Engineers, architects,and contractors can read those technical documents and transform them into scientific notationsand software applications.  They can extract any data they need, reason about it, and apply it atvarious phases of the project. How these extraction and use are carried out is a critical componentof automating the design review process.

  abstract = {Blockchain is a technology concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications beyond serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized and an immutable ledger that records every transaction made in the network. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would result in augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command by encouraging trust and collaboration. This paper present examines the potential integration with the BIM process in advancing the automation of the design review process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the automating the design review process by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The paper evaluates the potential application of blockchain technologies such as Smart Contracts in cybersecurity, data ownership and other aspects, as well as enhancing the framework for automating the design review process with a demonstration using Hyperledger Fabric.},

Further, since design is an open-ended problem (i.e., in general, there are a large number of design alternatives satisfying code provisions) the selection of the optimum design becomes an extremely challenging activity. The key approach to this problem is harnessing automation technologies beyond the traditional application of Building Information Modeling (BIM). The main focus of this paper is to discuss the development and interplay between Smart Codes and BIM and their role in simplifying and enhancing the design process. This includes studying the Smart Codes implementation in building design, BIM model requirements and their interaction with automated code checking systems.},

  abstract = {Building codes and regulatory standards are becoming increasingly complex with the acquisition of new knowledge in the design and construction domain. The necessity for computable representation of the building codes and regulations for automating the code checking process is becoming ever more critical. Within the framework of Building Information Modeling (BIM) work process, model checking against building regulations is generally needed to be an automatic or semi-automatic process. These checking mechanisms generally do not modify a building design, but rather evaluates a design on the basis of the configuration of objects, their relations and attributes. This paper presents a summary of the core existing methods for computerizing building codes and standards. It reviews main concepts for these methods including knowledge representation, reasoning procedures, and knowledge acquisition. Moreover, this study evaluates the capabilities of the reviewed methods in reference to their practical applications and applied limitations for modeling computable building codes and standards. Additionally, the paper proposes methods with practical flexibility of encoding building codes knowledge domain and at the same time possess transparent and verifiable syntax and sematic features. The suggested approaches rely on evidently identifying objective and subjective data of the regulatory text before formalizing building codes. The methodology realizes the limitations of the formalization systems by clearly identifying which components of the building codes and standards can be transformed into computable model and which parts can't be encoded and requires manual compliance checking.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a large language model conducting corporate lobbying related activities. An autoregressive large language model (OpenAI's text-davinci-003) determines if proposed U.S. Congressional bills are relevant to specific public companies and provides explanations and confidence levels. For the bills the model deems as relevant, the model drafts a letter to the sponsor of the bill in an attempt to persuade the congressperson to make changes to the proposed legislation. We use hundreds of novel ground-truth labels of the relevance of a bill to a company to benchmark the performance of the model. It outperforms the baseline of predicting the most common outcome of irrelevance. We also benchmark the performance of the previous OpenAI GPT-3 model (text-davinci-002), which was the state-of-the-art model on many academic natural language tasks until text-davinci-003 was recently released. The performance of text-davinci-002 is worse than the simple baseline. Longer-term, if AI begins to influence law in a manner that is not a direct extension of human intentions, this threatens the critical role that law as information could play in aligning AI with humans. Initially, AI is being used to simply augment human lobbyists for a small portion of their daily tasks. However, firms have an incentive to use less and less human oversight over automated assessments of policy ideas and the written communication to regulatory agencies and Congressional staffers. The core question raised is where to draw the line between human-driven and AI-driven policy influence.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies enable the AEC-FM industry to create a shared virtual model of a project. BIM not only includes 3D geometry information but also information assigned as parameters to BIM elements. However, the information stored in BIM model elements is not comprehensive. For example, a chiller manufacturer provides a large volume of product data in pdf file format that is not included in the BIM model. It is possible to attach PDF files to BIM elements; the problem with an attached PDF is that its content cannot be interpreted by a computer. Automated retrieval and integration of distributed sources of data requires data in a machine-processable format. One way to solve this problem is to manually add additional data as element properties to a BIM model. However, manually inputting data to BIM platforms (e.g. Autodesk Revit) is a very time consuming and error-prone task. In this article, the authors present the Semantic Web technology as a new solution to integrating building product manufacturers’ data with BIM information. The authors convert both BIM data and building product data to RDF/OWL format. Data stored in RDF/OWL format can be easily processed by machines and integrated with RDF/OWL formatted data from other sources over the Internet. The authors use Semantic Web Services to handle data communication between a BIM knowledge base and the product manufacturers’ knowledge bases. The authors compare manual entry of manufacturer data to a BIM model to the semantics-based data integration presented in the paper. Results show that the authors’ approach improves productivity.},

  abstract = {Cost estimating is a vital activity for contractors. Cost estimates require cost information collected from several sources. These sources include material and equipment suppliers. Current estimating software programs maintain a large database of resource cost data which must be updated before starting new estimates. The process of updating such databases is both time consuming and error prone. This paper discusses the architecture of a new approach to construction cost estimating using the semantic web technology. The semantic web technology structures data according to formal ontologies intended to promote machine understanding. Semantic web services provide interfaces for publishing information. The proposed estimating approach requires that suppliers encapsulate their product information within appropriate interfaces and make this information available to contractors through web services. Estimating software applications can retrieve the latest cost data from suppliers’ web services. The paper discusses how ontologies can be used to publish product information and develop ontology-based estimating applications. INTRODUCTION A building construction project is a collection of work items that produce building elements. To estimate the cost of a work item in a project, one needs to know the item quantity and the unit costs of the necessary resources. Current estimating applications keep a built-in database of resource (material, equipment, and labor) costs as shown in Figure 1. Item quantities are digitally extracted from a building model. Resource costs continuously change; however, current estimating applications do not have the built-in capability to update their cost databases. Therefore, estimators must obtain the latest resource costs from suppliers and manually update estimating application databases, which is a time consuming process.},

  abstract = {Abstract Architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC-FM) projects involve a large number of participants that must exchange information and combine their knowledge for successful completion of a project. Currently, most of the AEC-FM domains store their information about a project in text documents or use XML, relational, or object-oriented formats that make information integration difficult. The AEC-FM industry is not taking advantage of the full potential of the Semantic Web for streamlining sharing, connecting, and combining information from different domains. The Semantic Web is designed to solve the information integration problem by creating a web of structured and connected data that can be processed by machines. It allows combining information from different sources with different underlying schemas distributed over the Internet. In the Semantic Web, all data instances and data schema are stored in a graph data store, which makes it easy to merge data from different sources. This paper presents a shared ontology approach to semantic representation of building information. The semantic representation of building information facilitates finding and integrating building information distributed in several knowledge bases. A case study demonstrates the development of a semantic based building design knowledge base.},

  abstract = {Abstract In response to the growing concerns about climate change and the environment, sustainable design of buildings is increasingly demanded by building owners and users. However, fast evaluation of various design options and identification of the optimized design requires application of design analysis tools such as energy modeling, daylight simulations, and natural ventilation analysis software. Energy analysis requires access to distributed sources of information such as building element material properties provided by designers, mechanical equipment information provided by equipment manufacturers, weather data provided by weather reporting agencies, and energy cost data from energy providers. Gathering energy related information from different sources and inputting the information to an energy analysis application is a time consuming process. This causes delays and increases the time for comparing different design alternatives. This paper discusses how Semantic Web technology can facilitate information collection from several sources for energy analysis. Semantic Web enables sharing, accessing, and combining information over the Internet in a machine process-able format. This would free building designers to concentrate on building design optimization rather than spending time on data preparation and manual entry into energy analysis applications.},

In this paper, focussing on tunnelling engineering, we demonstrate a systematic and versatile approach to efficiently generate a tunnel design and analyse the lining in different practical scenarios. To this end, a BIM-based approach is developed, which connects a user-friendly industry-standard BIM software with effective simulation tools for high-performance computing. A fully automatized design-through-analysis workflow solution for segmented tunnel lining is developed based on a fully parametric design model and an isogeometric analysis software, connected through an interface implemented with a Revit plugin.},

Performance here means not only the visual aesthetic but also energy, environ- mental impact, service life, whole-life cost, fire safety, accessibility and much more. To bring all of this to bear at a virtual construction requires considerable discipline in identifying, organizing and integrating information, what it is, where it comes from, who is responsible for it and so on. If information is identified or presented differently from discrete sources, many of the potential benefits of virtual construction are lost. Currently, regulatory controls impact on the freedom to explore design options. Consistent information results from agreements by industry to use a common ex- pression of ideas. These are now emerging through the development of dictionaries in various countries; these will develop to provide a consistent and multi-lingual on- tology that can be used in web-based virtual construction and in regulatory domains. This chapter examines the application of standards in both the domains. It shows that the major obstacles to the wider adoption of automatic building regulatory approval are being addressed so that the risk of delay and abortive costs associated with the approval gateway can be removed. The focus will be on the germination of current ideas and how these will be likely to grow to meet real business need.},

  abstract = {In both the Geo and BIM domains, it is widely acknowledged that the integration of geo-data and BIM-data is beneficial and a crucial step in facing the multi-disciplinary challenges of our built environment. The result of this integration – broadly termed as GeoBIM – has a range of potential uses from district study to road safety. However, from the data perspective, this integration raises the question of how to integrate very detailed design and construction data from the BIM domain with contextual geospatial data (both 2D and 3D) that model a very diverse range of aspects of the wider built and natural environment. This paper reports work carried out during the second phase of the EuroSDR GeoBIM project, which sets out to understand the general status of GeoBIM across Europe with particular focus from a National Mapping and Cadastral Agency perspective. The first phase of the project reviewed the current status of GeoBIM in participating countries and identified the need for specific detailed use cases to overcome both the lack of awareness and the lack of understanding of the potential of GeoBIM. We present both an update on the current status of GeoBIM, and additional details of one of the selected use cases relating to planning/development permits. For the latter, we have been able to develop a detailed workflow highlighting specific data exchange points within the process to issue a development permit, allowing a more in-depth identification of both the roles and data needs at each stage.},

However, in current practice, the building permit issuing as well as the integration of geoinformation with BIM (GeoBIM) suffers from a number of complex sub-issues. These issues still remain and prevent the development of successful methodologies. In this paper, the building permit use case is explored within a project in close collaboration with the municipality of Rotterdam. A very specific case study in Rotterdam was selected as a starting point, which allowed us to develop the needed methodology for the implementation of an effective tool. In this paper we highlight the interpretation and formalization of regulation for building height, overhang and tower ratio. While these rules are specific to a zoning plan in Rotterdam, we believe that the methodology and encountered issues in formalizing the rules, applying the rules on delivered models and integrating various data sources (BIM and GIS specifically) are general to most building codes.},

  abstract = {The integration of 3D city models with Building Information Models (BIM), coined as GeoBIM, facilitates improved data support to several applications, e.g., 3D map updates, building permits issuing, detailed city analysis, infrastructure design, context-based building design, to name a few. To solve the integration, several issues need to be tackled and solved, i.e., harmonization of features, interoperability, format conversions, integration of procedures. The GeoBIM benchmark 2019, funded by ISPRS and EuroSDR, evaluated the state of implementation of tools addressing some of those issues. In particular, in the part of the benchmark described in this paper, the application of georeferencing to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models and making consistent conversions between 3D city models and BIM are investigated, considering the OGC CityGML and buildingSMART IFC as reference standards. In the benchmark, sample datasets in the two reference standards were provided. External volunteers were asked to describe and test georeferencing procedures for IFC models and conversion tools between CityGML and IFC. From the analysis of the delivered answers and processed datasets, it was possible to notice that while there are tools and procedures available to support georeferencing and data conversion, comprehensive definition of the requirements, clear rules to perform such two tasks, as well as solid technological solutions implementing them, are still lacking in functionalities. Those specific issues can be a sensible starting point for planning the next GeoBIM integration agendas.},

The executed research shows that the mainly addressed aspects of the digitalization of building permit process are the technologies to check the compliance of design proposals against regulations, followed by the digitalization of regulations. Improvable aspects identified in the entire building permit system are instead e.g. the involvement of officers, scalability of solutions and interoperability of data, intended both as data validation and as integration of geospatial data with building models.},

  abstract = {Many organizations rely on data from government and third-party sources, and those sources and organizations do not follow the same data formatting. This introduces challenges in integrating data from multiple sources. Commercial database systems do not offer adequate support for integrating data from heterogeneous sources, and manual integration is both time-consuming and inefficient. While state-of-the-art approaches rely on similarity functions and textual transformations, they often fail to handle challenging cases where multiple mappings are required, or the mappings go beyond simple textual transformations. In this paper, we study the potential of deep neural models for transforming tables for joinability. In particular, we cast the problem as a prediction task and develop a framework that leverages large deep-learning language models to transform tabular data from a source formatting to a desired target representation. Our framework can efficiently learn the pattern for mapping the source formatting into the expected target using just a few examples, which can then be used for table joining, filling in missing values, and error detection. Compared to state-of-the-art mapping and joining approaches, our framework delivers noticeably more accurate and scalable performance on both real-world and synthetic datasets. Our experimental evaluation also shows that the performance of the proposed framework using our fine-tuned model is at par or better than large language models such as GPT-3, despite the significant difference in size, and that integrating large language models into our framework improves their performance.},

To address this issue, this paper presents a general compatibility analysis method that propose scanning the modules in manufacturing plant and construction site, and check module-to-module compatibility remotely, prior to the shipment and installation. This study provides three sample module-to-module compatibility scenarios to validate the proposed compatibility analysis. The case study results show that the compatibility analysis method was able to identify the compatibility issues with high accuracy. Lastly, the compatibility analysis method was validated in terms of accuracy and time performance in six scenarios that was defined on the modules.}

It supports almost every activity of our society: living, working, learning, healthcare, transport, entertainment, leisure, and sports. The Built Environment’s proper functioning is dependent on information. As our world becomes more digital, how we produce, manage and exchange “information” on a construction project - known as Building Information Modelling or BIM - is increasingly important. BIM is a process for creating and managing information on a construction project across the lifecycle of the project. An output of this process is the Building Information Model; the digital description of every aspect of the built asset from information assembled collaboratively and updated at key stages of a project. This model enables those who interact with the building to optimize their actions, resulting in a greater whole life value for the asset. Standards for BIM are critical to a “smart society”. The standards do not only streamline the methodologies to produce or manage this digital data, but also the structure of the data itself. Standards ensure interoperability between information systems, and prevent the expensive loss or corruption of data. The I.S. EN ISO 19650 series are the key BIM standards, having been adopted by ISO, CEN and nationally, as standards for managing information over the whole life cycle of a built asset using BIM. In 2021 we adopted a National Annex to Part 2 in that series; NA:2021 to I.S. EN ISO 19650-2:2018. This National Annex provides guidance on how to implement I.S. EN ISO 19650-2:2018 within the national context of construction projects. More specifically, it contains the Irish technical parameters on data components used in BIM, such as field identification and information containers. The entire I.S. EN ISO 19650 series, including the National Annex, can be purchased on the NSAI store.}

  abstract = {Cities are an integral part to meeting the world's sustainable energy goals. Specifically, retrofits have been implemented to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in the buildings sector. Recent simulation, reduced-order, and data-driven approaches have been used to predict the current energy consumption of urban buildings. However, these efforts are limited in their ability to evaluate potential impacts of future retrofits as they are unable to account for inter-building energy interactions that can influence urban building energy performance. To overcome these limitations, we extend a previously developed hybrid data-driven urban energy simulation (DUE-S) model that leverages building energy simulations and deep learning models by now predicting the impact of various building energy retrofits on multiple spatiotemporal scales across a city. We evaluate this approach on a case study of 29 densely co-located buildings in downtown Sacramento, California, USA. Our results indicate that accounting for urban context can compound the impact of retrofits on individual buildings by up to 7.4\% as they also influence the electricity use of their surroundings. Finally, we show how DUE-S can provide insights on how to select buildings for retrofit that captures a potential compounding energy savings effect. We develop a greedy optimization algorithm that minimizes the number of required retrofits needed to achieve maximal energy savings across an urban study area. As a result, this work underscores how a flexible urban energy prediction model such as DUE-S can help inform energy-related decisions for a variety of urban-minded stakeholders including architects, engineers, planners, and policymakers.},

However, there is little interoperability between current rule-based systems. Interoperation is one of the main goals of the Semantic Web, and developing a language for sharing rules is often seen as a key step in reaching this goal. The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is an important first step in defining such a rule language. This paper describes the development of a configurable interoperation environment for SWRL built in Protégé-OWL, the most widely-used OWL development platform. This environment supports both a highly-interactive, full-featured editor for SWRL and a plugin mechanism for integrating third party rule engines. We have integrated the popular Jess rule engine into this environment, thus providing one of the first steps on the path to rule integration on the Web.},

  abstract = {This presentation describes the use of linked data approaches to permit queries across large, diverse information sources to allow reasoning about complex questions at multiple geographic scales. The developed methodology leverages a central spine model that provides a common hierarchical context; various heterogeneous external information sources can be associated with these contexts, creating a homogeneous data network that can be queried using federated SPARQL queries. These distributed sources are, in themselves, registered in a central catalogue in order to facilitate data discovery; the actual data, however, remains under the control of their source organisations. In this way a large, extensible, interconnected network of distributed data describing a built environment can be constructed; this network can be queried centrally to provide customised views of subsets of the data.. The utility of the architecture is demonstrated by establishing a data network to support Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) analysts to investigate the impact of various decarbonisation scenarios on the Irish transmission grid. An instance of the Dynamic District Information Model (DDIM) server was used for this analysis. Large datasets were necessary to support this investigation, including details of 220 transmission nodes, c.16,500 small areas and approximately 2 million residential buildings. A series of residential energy archetypes were developed, including as-is and energy consumption per residence archetype for numerous scenarios, including the adoption of heat pumps and electric vehicles. It was found that the DDIM approach enabled integration of large scale and heterogeneous datasets, finer grained data analysis, and improved the accuracy of the analysis.},

  abstract = {Geographic Information System (GIS) can provide impor- tant contextual information relevant to buildings design, such as related to flooding, orientation, and even construction materials. Currently there is a disconnect between 2D GIS and 3D Building Information Modelling (BIM), as both tend to work from different geometric representations and coordinate systems hindering seamless integration of these repre- sentations. This paper presents a method for converting Industry Foun- dation Classes (IFC) geometries expressed in ifcOWL with additional GeoSPARQL, based upon the IFC defined geolocation, focusing on walls. The goal is to align these geometries with their GIS equivalents, so that an existing IFC model can be overlaid with GIS, or vice versa, allow- ing for the seamless movement between the geometries in either domain. This also makes possible the tagging of all BIM geometries with geoloca- tion. To support the publication of this data, the paper also presents an export of the resulting GeoSPARQL aligned with the developing stan- dard the Building Topology Ontology (BOT), thus enabling the linking of multiple geometric representations to a less verbose building reference model. A short evaluation of the performance of the algorithm for con- version is also presented as well as a test case to examine alignment of BIM with geospatial geometric representations.},

  abstract = {The building permission process is to a large extent an analogue process where much information is handled in paper format or as pdf files. With the ongoing digitalisation in society, there is a potential to automate this process by integrating Building Information Models (BIM) of planned buildings and geospatial data to check if a building conforms to the building permission regulations. In this study, an inventory of which regulations in the (Swedish) detailed development plans that can be automatically checked or supported by 3D visualisation was conducted. Then, two of these regulations, the building height and the building footprint area, were studied in detail to find to which extent they can be automatically checked by integration of BIM and geospatial data. In addition, a feasibility study of one visual criterion was conducted. One concern when automating the building permission process is the variability of content within the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model. Variations in modelling methods and model content leads to differences in IFC models\&rsquo; content and structure; these differences complicate automated processes. To facilitate automated processes, requirements on the production of IFC models for building permission applications could be defined in the form of model view definitions or delivery specifications.},

In D2.1, we already discussed different options that can be used to model buildings, from traditional IFC step files, to the more recently adopted linked data formats. Pros and cons of each solutions in the context  of  a  renovation  scenario  were  discussed,  and  a  first  draft  of  a  linked  data  approach  was elaborated.In  the  present  document,  we  present  the  BIM4Ren  ontology  and  the  main  concepts  used.  The ontology is a set of different ontologies, that are fully modular, i.e. for each project, different modules can be used and left appart. This works is the BIM4Ren proposal to modularising existing standards, and  more  particularly  IFC,  an  issue  that  is  currently  under  study  by  the  buildingSmart  technical community.  In  the  current  deliverable,  we  also  present  someconversion  procedures,  to  ease interoperability  between  different  formats.  The  BIM4Ren  ontology  is  indeed  referencing  concepts from Omniclass, or IFC itself, and we show two different ways to convert building models from IFC to BIM4Ren.The first approachis based on inference rules, that are interpreted by a reasoner embedded in a triple store.We  discussed  its  implementation,  scalability  and  limitations.  The  second  one  is  a  Java-based program, implemented as a BIM Bot.With the present document, the BIM model storage facilities are covered.},

The aspirations are well in line with open BIM- and the linked building data (LBD) community to use open data standards in Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. Our previous research introduced the bcfOWL ontology to express BCF data using the open Web of Data standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as part of the Linked Building Data (LBD). The current BCF API standard expresses changes in the model as event logs that indirectly describe the modifications. The focus is on different changes issue descriptions are going through in the course of a life cycle of a building. This paper presents four different approaches for expressing the temporal changes as Linked Data. Two RDF-star approaches and a state construction inspired by the Ontology for Property Management (OPM) are introduced. Moreover, we show Event System method that is close to the original BCF API. To compare the approaches, queries to get the current data and search the history are provided on an external repository.

Linked Building Data is widely used in research projects and actively advances by the researchers in the World Wide Web Consortium Linked Building Data Community Group. buildingSMART is a worldwide organization that develops standards to enable collaboration and digital BIM workflows. The buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD) is an international standard that defines a hierarchically structured encyclopedia of object concepts and their properties used in building information models. It is provided as is an online service. While there have been earlier work where data exports of bSDD have been expressed as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and used in linked data, a consistent approach for keeping them automatically up to date has been missing. In this work, I study how to publish the buildingSMART Data Dictionary classifications and terms as a web ontology, use them in the Linked Building Data context, and keep the data in sync with the buildingSMART Data Dictionary primary data. I present an online ontology generator that ad-hoc provides up-to-date ontology descriptions of concepts in the buildingSMART database.The earlier work is presented in this work, and the feasibility of the online live updates for the ontologies that reflect the bSDD database data is shown. The results are reflected and compared with the earlier work. This paper summarizes ways to publish the bSDD vocabularies as linked data in a sustainable way.},

Unfortunately, IFC models consist mostly of anonymous objects without stable identities; therefore the computation of differences between versions is complicated. When IFC models are converted into an RDF representation, the uniform graph structure offers new algorithmic opportunities. We study how to assign unique and stable identities to anonymous nodes based on signatures generated from their graph environment, and present the Short Paths Crossings Algorithm (SPCA) that computes sets of paths with limited length from anonymous nodes taking into account their crossings. Empirical tests show that SPCA produces significantly smaller difference sets for IFC-derived graphs than previous algorithms for RDF change detection.},

  abstract = {The utilization of building information modeling (BIM) has been rapidly increasing in the last decade as it stimulates project constructability, quality, efficiency, and success. A well-structured and organized information system is the major requirement to ensure adequate collection, management and dissemination of documentation and the central BIM-model for the whole project team. This consistent source of information, called as the common data environment (CDE), carries an important role to achieve a centralized information system in the BIM-based construction projects. Despite the general perception, common data environments (CDEs) should not be considered only as a digital storage and sharing space. A CDE system, set up at the beginning of the project according to the international standards, can support the successful project management by providing instant insights related to the project performance and eliminating non-value adding activities (e.g., rework, defect). Although the CDE is an ultimate necessity for a data-driven construction project management, the literature remains quite incapable of revealing the functions of the CDE system. The aim of this study is to identify and categorize the CDE functions used in the construction phase of BIM-based projects. In the first step, possible CDE functions were derived from a literature review and online sources. In the second step, semi-structured focused interviews were conducted with five subject matter experts who use the CDE system efficiently in the international BIM-based construction projects. This methodology allows to link aspects of different perspectives and achieve meaningful and reliable outputs. The results will provide valuable information about the CDE functions in the BIM-based construction projects to practitioners and researchers. Further, this research can create awareness about the CDEs and encourage the use of CDEs in the BIM projects.

  abstract = {This paper aims to describe rule checking method, classification and its demonstration. As applications of BIM extends, there have been some challenging projects on automated building compliance checking. The current rule-making method is developercentered and thus is difficult to define rules without propound programming knowledge. This paper introduces high level rule making methods with law sentence-centered approach. The proposed methods have intuitive naming convention and are directly mapped with the predicate of the law sentences. Therefore, it is easy to infer function of the methods. According to the type of object and property in instance level, three hierarchies of method classification were set: 1) level 1 divides types of instance, 2) level 2 classifies the type of property, and 3) level 3 specifies the content of checking. From the level 3, representative rule checking method is defined. The representative method is subdivided into extended methods according to the specific object and property to check. The rule checking methods are combined together to form an intermediate pseudocode. The pseudo-code is later to be parsed into computer executable form. This paper mainly focuses on 1) introducing law sentence -centered rule checking method, 2) object and property-based classification of rule checking method, 3) method extensibility and 4) demonstration of rule checking methods with actual requirement sentences from the Korea Building Permit. The high level rule checking method is developed as a part of KBimLogic. KBimLogic is a software that translates the Korea Building Permit requirement into computer executable format. KBimLogic is now under development with government funding.},

A key component of the IMF is a Foundation Data Model (FDM), built upon a top-level ontology (TLO), as a basis for ensuring consistent data across the NDT. This document captures the results collected from a broad survey of top-level ontologies, conducted by the IMF technical team. It focuses on the core ontological choices made in their foundations and the pragmatic engineering consequences these have on how the ontologies can be applied and further scaled. This document will provide the basis for discussions on a suitable TLO for the FDM. It is also expected that these top-level ontologies will provide a resource whose components can be harvested and adapted for inclusion in the FDM.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Data models are the backbone of digital information exchange, since they contain the structure of data to be exchanged. Just as information requirements vary, so do data models – in level of detail, level of abstraction, and domain coverage. Due to these differences, communication between some data models is easy and between others is difficult. Regarding the Building Information Model (BIM) initiative, the IFC standard data model varies in detail, abstraction level, and large domain coverage. In contrast, the Austrian ÖGG-guideline has a consistent detail and abstraction level focusing on a single domain, subsurface engineering. In order to participate in a loss- and distortion-free information exchange, a reliable translation via a multitude of data models is a must-have.             In this paper, we present formal criteria for distinguishing between semantics-carrying data models, such as IFC and ÖGG, and translating data models that provide reliable communication bridges between them, such as CAEX and SIMULTAN. We will show that translating data models are an indispensable part of the data model infrastructure even within a single domain. For evaluation purpose, we demonstrate our approach on a subsurface engineering use case.},

  abstract = {BIM for Facilities Management (BIM for FM) is a relatively new and growing topic of inquiry aiming to fulfil the informational needs of the operational phase of assets within increasingly digitalised project workflows. Research into the management of structured (i.e. graphical and non-graphical) and unstructured data (i.e. documents) has largely focused on design and construction phases. Information management in facilities management and maintenance is still challenged by the lack of a structured framework that can simultaneously fulfil these three capabilities: (1) the delivery of information models (i.e. Asset Information Models) from distributed data sources; (2) the validation of these information models against the requirements; and (3) the use of their information in facilities management (e.g. operation and maintenance). This research aims to develop and test a framework and a prototype Common Data Environment (CDE) to achieve these three capabilities. The framework and the developed CDE are entirely based on use open standards and integration of existing technologies. A requirements model, underpinning the framework and the CDE was developed during three iterative stages of interviews –in line with the adopted Grounded Theory and Design Science Research methodologies– with industry experts and through a three-stage coding process at each iteration. The framework and the CDE were tested in pilot demonstrations with a use case focused on preventive and reactive maintenance. The testing demonstrated that the implementation of ‘BIM for FM’ processes is feasible with the proposed framework and CDE relying entirely on open standards and existing technologies. Some additional requirements for BIM for FM processes were also identified during the verification sessions with industry and are proposed for future research.},

  abstract = {Accurate and valid data is essential during the development of building projects and throughout the use phase of buildings. This study proposes a framework to help owners and facility managers in: (a) defining the requirements for asset management tasks in a structured way; (b) validating project and asset data against the established requirements; and (c) visualising asset data, stored in different and distributed sources, in an integrated and interactive way to support specific asset/facility management functions (e.g. maintenance tasks). The framework combines the use of Information Delivery Manual (IDM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie), and Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) in the development of Asset Information Models (AIM) to fulfil the owner’s requirements (Asset Information Requirements) throughout the lifecycle of a building. An AIM is a data model that contains all digital data (graphical, non-graphical, and documentary) required to operate an asset or portfolio of assets. Validation methods are identified for each of the AIM data types and a method for their integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual environment. The proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the validation of the various data sources against the client requirements, defined in the Asset Information Requirement (AIR); and (2) the visualisation of asset data required for a maintenance task in an interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the capability of the framework to enable the definition of AIR and the validation of the different AIM’s data deliverables. The visualisation of the AIM data - from different and distributed sources - for a maintenance task was successfully performed in an integrated and interactive game environment. Future work will consider other data sources and will evaluate the proposed framework using real industrial data.},

  abstract = {BIM-based tools can contribute to addressing some of the challenges faced by structural engineering practitioners. A BIM-based framework for the development of components that deliver Automatic Code Compliance (ACC) is presented. The structural design problems that such components solve are categorised as simple, where ACC can be implemented directly, or complex, where more advanced approaches are needed. The mathematical process of Multi-Dimensional Data Fitting (MDDF) is introduced in order for the latter, enabling the compression of complex engineering calculations to a single equation that can be easily implemented into a BIM software engineering package. Proof-of-concept examples are given for both cases: offsite-manufactured structural joists are utilised as a non-recursive example, implementing the results obtained in the manufacturer’s literature; the axial capacity of metal fasteners in axially loaded timber-to-timber connections are utilised as an example of recursive problems. The MDDF analysis and its implementation in a BIM package of those problems are presented. Finally, the concept is generalised for non-structural aspects at a framework level, and the challenges, implications, and prospects of ACC in a BIM context are discussed.},

  abstract = {Building service systems are complex structures with varying relationships between different components. In the design, planning, construction, commissioning and operation of these systems, many stakeholders with different interests and information needs have to work together, which further increases the overall complexity. Building Information Modeling (BIM) was introduced to enhance the interoperability providing a machine-readable representation consisting of semantical, geometrical and alphanumerical information. Semantic web technologies enable further improvement of the interoperability by linking information on data level using a global unique identification key in a web-based decentralized data store. To contribute to these developments, a brief literature review covering representations of building service systems such as IfcOWL, BRICK, SAREF and a comparison of their scopes and core concepts is given. Based on these findings, recent developments regarding the TUBES system ontology (TSO) and their alignment to the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) are presented. TSO strives to represent interconnected building service systems and their exchange of energy, mass and data on different levels of granularity based on the general system theory. The ontology is validated using a real-life project.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of information management and information exchange applications in construction industry is relying on semantic web technologies or tools from the Linked Open Data (LOD) domain to support data interoperability, flexible data exchange, distributed data management and the development of reusable tools. These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology.},

By deploying the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a description language, these systems offer building information in a widely interoperable format, so that several applications are able to infer extra information. For a certain functionality, IFC shows limitations however. Existing semantic web technology may be able to overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building design and construction. An implemented test case for acoustic performance checking illustrates the improvements of such an environment compared to traditionally deployed approaches in rule checking.},

  abstract = {As more and more architectural design and construction data is represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model, it makes sense to take advantage of the underlying logical basis of RDF and realise a semantic rule-checking process as it is currently not available in architectural design and construction industry. Such a semantic rule-checking process would be of considerable value to regulation compliance checking procedures, because the additional logical basis would (1) allow consistency checking of the rules in the regulations (and thus a better management of the rules), (2) allow a faster, more transparent and more reliable implementation of regulation compliance checking procedures (rules are human-readable and more easily changeable), and (3) provide the option to rely on available reasoning engines and generate proofs without any additional implementation effort. Obviously, there are a number of strategies and approaches that can be followed regarding the realisation of such a rule-checking process. In this article, we will outline a number of rule-checking approaches that have been reported for semantic rule-checking in the AEC domain, including rule-based checking algorithms implemented on BIM platforms as plug-ins, Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rule based checking relying on an external rule engine, and N3Logic-based rule checking using a backward-chaining procedure. For every approach, a number of implementation procedures will be considered. This will result in a comprehensive strategic overview at the end of the paper, which can be used as a guide for parties interested in implementing a semantic rule-checking process for regulation compliance checking.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over the recent years, the usage of semantic web technologies has notably increased in the domains of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the AEC domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains. Results show that semantic web technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g. BIM + Infra + GIS + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2) devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures.},

Diverse approaches have already been presented for addressing this challenge. This article will look into the possibility of addressing the interoperability challenge in the building life-cycle with a linked data approach. An outline is given of how linked data technologies tend to be deployed, thereby working towards a “more holistic” perspective on the building, or towards a large-scale web of “linked building data”. From this overview, and the associated use case scenarios, we conclude that the interoperability challenge cannot be “solved” using linked data technologies, but that it can be addressed. In other words, information exchange and management can be improved, but a pragmatic usage of technologies is still required in practice. Finally, we give an initial outline of some anticipated use cases in the building life-cycle in which the usage of linked data technologies may generate advantages over existing technologies and methods.},

Business owners must be convinced the ROI is there and users must see that the learning curve is not so disruptive that it impacts the project schedule. There can also be reluctance to embrace technology designed to address a process that has “always been done that way.” Nearly everyone agrees that IT makes sense and it is inevitable in the coming years. The questions that need to be addressed are what to adopt and how to do it remain the primary concerns?

  abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, is transforming decision-making through the increasing use of information and digitization technologies. While Industry 4.0 is expanding rapidly in manufacturing industries, its induced transformations are gradually affecting other sectors, including the construction industry. In recent years, the use of 4.0 technologies in the construction industry, termed as ‘Construction 4.0’, has increased, mostly due to the immense potential of Industry 4.0 for improving the performance of construction projects and structuring their underlying management processes. This paper proposes a classification of existing literature on applications of Construction 4.0 technologies to allow for a better analysis of trends and gaps in the research. A total of nearly 200 research papers between 2009 and 2020 were reviewed and analyzed. Overall, the analysis shows that research on Construction 4.0 is closely aligned with the construction phase. Also, the most researched topics seem to be related to the management processes of quality, risk, and health and safety.},

This has been achieved by designing a description language, based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL), that is used to define boundary representations (BREP) of objects. This involves representing geometric entities in a semantic meaningful way, e.g., a circle is defined by a coordinate frame and a radius instead of a set of polygons. Furthermore, the scope of this semantic description language also covers geometric constraints between multiple objects. Constraints can be specified not only on the object level, but down to single edges or faces of an object. This semantic representation is used to improve a variety of applications, ranging from shape-based object recognition to constraint-based robot task descriptions. Results from a quantitative evaluation are presented to assess the practicability of this approach.},

Data mining allows users to obtain such insights from the large datasets generated throughout the building life cycle. Furthermore, semantic web and linked data technologies allow to formally represent the built environment and retrieve knowledge in response to domain-specific requirements. Both approaches have independently established themselves as powerful aids in decision-making. Combining both can enrich data mining processes with domain knowledge and facilitate knowledge discovery, representation and reuse. In this article, we look into the available data mining techniques and investigate to what extent they can be fused with semantic web technologies, to provide recommendations to the end user in a performance-oriented design process. We demonstrate an initial implementation of a linked data-based system for generation of recommendations.},

Such knowledge can be of particular importance to decision-making for building performance improvement, however, this requires patterns discovered with traditional data mining techniques to be attributed with semantics, so that they can be machine-interpretable and reusable. Using linked data-based crowdsourcing techniques for interpretation of building performance patterns enables the creation of knowledge graphs of building data, enriched with contextualized building performance insights. This paper presents a crowdsourcing mechanism that allows the semantic enrichment of building performance patterns through semantic annotation and classification.

  abstract = {The report investigates the current state of classification for the built infrastructure environment, while acknowledging that present tools and systems need to recognise the rapid move towards a full digital description of assets and there their functions. It examines criteria for transition and future classification systems. In addition the report looks towards fully information modelled outputs and linked information, which create a ‘Smart Infrastructure’ world. Summary of conclusions drawn in this report:  - Classification allows us to understand and identify object types and the properties associated with them. - There are a number of critical criteria that should characterise choice of classification tools identified and laid out in the report. - Most current classification systems are still evolving and developing and hence do not meet all future and present requirements. All require further development to fill the current gaps in their implementation.in - There is a danger of trying to force fit BIM requirements into classification systems that were designed for the analogue era rather than evolving them for the digital engineering future. - The industry is in a transition phase moving from analogue information capture and distribution to a fully digital one. - The tools we chose during this migration phase must support both but lead us towards fully digital as soon as possible. - There is no specific Classification system that can be recommended however the features and aims of CCS \& CoClass which combine the requirements of current facet and enumerated standards plus uses reference designation approach defining relationships and aims culminate in asset delivery comes closest to meeting the criteria. However, it is recognised that there are some issues relating to the use of function as a main sub-divider which need to be resolved. - Although classification is often used to generate intelligent name labels for objects and features in CAD and BIM Models this should be regarded as a transitionary process used whilst users still rely on design current design tools. - The question of the difference between a Project Information Model (PIM) and an asset Information Model (AIM) is redundant.  Information about an asset is created at the start of a project and evolves through the life cycle, which includes planning and delivery projects to become the complete asset information. In other words, information through life cycle is progressive. The only difference would be the during the design and construction stages contractual and progress information would be attached to the asset under development. - A rigid hierarchical view of classification should be avoided in future classification but rather a more recursive hierarchy be adopted. - There should be an effort to simplify classification. - Future digital engineering should look to identifying an object type, instantiating it with a unique reference and linking it to properties that define that instantiated object rather than cross referring to multiple complex tables. In other words, simplifying identity rather than adding complexity by including in a string of constructs from many tables. - The use of object types with related properties associated with classification has potential to simplify what has become a very complex subject. - The existing systems have much information that could be used as a basis to build object type libraries. - It is suggested that development of Nordic Object Type Libraries would bring together many of the current disparate approaches. - Whilst the object type library and semantically linked information approach to identifying and relating information is in its relative infancy there is little doubt that it provides a good solution to the industry’s needs in the medium to long term. - Although the industry is not yet fully prepared for a linked data approach we should endeavour to prepare for it by incorporating it into our standards and make it our direction of travel.},

Previous research on the adoption of performance assessment tools by the design community suggested that the extensive amount of time, effort and expertise required to accumulate and provide input information for various performance evaluations, limits the application of such tools for improvement of building design in early stages. Even the most rudimentary performance inquiries require large quantities of data regarding the properties of incorporated building materials and systems, climatic conditions, building codes, etc. Much of this data is available on the internet, yet its use is severely hampered by lack of appropriate structure and format. The SEMERGY research and development project was conceived with the aim of acquiring and utilizing the abundant, yet ill-structured building-related data available on the World Wide Web, through implementation of Semantic Web Technologies. This web-based data is utilized within a flexible, multi-objective design optimization environment, incorporating various performance assessment applications. The present contribution describes some of the major challenges of the project, discusses the adopted approaches, and presents SEMERGY's main features.},

The essential outcome of this work is a data-driven prediction tool for energy performance labels that can run automatically. The tool is based on the cutting edge kNN classification algorithm and trained on open datasets with actual building data such as those coming from the IoT paradigm. Additionally, it assesses the results of the prediction by analysing its accuracy values. Furthermore, an approach to semantic annotations for energy performance certification data with currently available ontologies is presented.

Decision support systems are often used to assist in bringing together disparate data sources and presenting them in a cohesive way to the decision-makers. TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), is one of the numerous MultiCriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods, which has been successfully applied in a variety of practical and real-world challenges. This paper reviews 45 published papers that used TOPSIS approaches in building and construction published from 2011 to 2021 to assess the applicability of TOPSIS. The most relevant papers relating to the TOPSIS technique were analysed and classified into application areas. The review indicated that TOPSIS is flexible and can be used to solve construction decisionmaking problems as a stand-alone tool or in conjunction with other tools. This paper contributes to the discussion on useful approaches to IT-based systems.},

When used for research, ontologies should be treated as other research artefacts, such as data, software, methods, etc.; following the same principles used to make them findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) to others. However, in comparison to the number of guides, indicators and recommendations available for making research data FAIR, not much attention has been paid so far on how to publish ontologies following the FAIR principles. This position paper reviews the technical and social needs required to define a roadmap for generating and publishing FAIR ontologies on the Web.

  abstract = {One of the most important issues during the planning of a construction project is to maintain the quality of the design planning constantly at a high level. Therefore this quality must be checked continuously in terms of accuracy and compliance to the applicable codes and guidelines throughout the duration of a project. Nowadays this checking process is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone since it is mostly performed manually based on two-dimensional planning and iteratively at each planning change by the responsible planning consultant. Recently, various approaches attempted to automate this highly relevant process with the help of digital methods, such as Building Information Modeling, in order to reduce the amount of work and increase the quality of the planning at the same time. Although this Automated Code Compliance Checking has been implemented using a variety of different methods, most of the existing approaches fail because they represent the information of rules in an insufficient or overly complex manner. In this paper a short analysis of the pros and cons of selected existing approaches is given and subsequently minimal requirements for a successful automation of this process are defined. To counteract the lacks and insufficiencies of existing approaches, a new method is introduced which enables an automation using a flow-based, visual programming language, which we call Visual Code Checking Language (VCCL). Finally the practical implementation of a semi-automated compliance check concerning an exemplary German fire code demonstrates the viability of the approach.},

  abstract = {In the construction industry, a large number of codes and guidelines define technical specifications and standardized requirements to ensure a building’s structural stability, accessibility, and energy efficiency, among others. Today, checking the compliance with the applicable guidelines is an iterative, manual process which is based to a large extent on 2D drawings. In consequence, this process is cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone. With the increasing adoption of digital methods in the construction industry, most importantly Building Information Modeling (BIM), new technologies are available to improve and partially automate this process. In a BIM-based construction project, digital models that include 3D geometric as well as semantic information comprehensively describe the building to be erected across the different involved disciplines. This rich information provides an excellent basis for automating the code compliance checking process. With Automated Code Compliance Checking, not only a higher degree of compliance with the different regulations can be achieved, but also a significant reduction of effort is possible. The chapter first discusses the major challenges of Automated Code Compliance Checking. Subsequently, representative available software solutions are presented and current research activities are discussed. Finally, an outlook for the development of code compliance checking in the construction industry is given.},

  abstract = {In the AEC industry, there is a large number of standards and codes which ensure the structural stability, reliability, usability of the building under design. Accordingly, checking the conformity of the building design with these requirements is a crucial process. Nowadays this checking is performed to a large extent manually based on two-dimensional technical drawings and textual documents. Due to the low level of automation, the conventional checking procedure is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone. As Building Information Modeling (BIM) becomes more and more mature, a suitable digital information basis also becomes available to enable automating the process. The commercial solutions for code compliance checking available so far mainly follow a black-box approach where the rules that make up a certain regulation are implemented in a hard-wired fashion rendering their implementation in-transparent and non-extendable. A number of researchers have tackled this problem and have proposed various ways that allow the user to define rules, either in a standard programming language or in a dedicated language. However, AEC domain experts usually do not have the required programming skills to use these languages appropriately. To overcome this issue, we introduce the Visual Code Checking Language (VCCL), which uses a graphical notation in order to represent the rules of a code in a machine- and human-readable language. The paper presents the features and functionalities of the VCCL in detail and shows its application in a number of case studies.},

  abstract = {Background With the rising adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the AEC sector, computational models supersede traditional ways of information provision based on textual documents and two-dimensional drawings. The use of models enables the streamlining of workflows, and the included virtual construction increases the quality of the final product, the building. To create a comprehensive description of a planned building, information from different sources must be combined, specified and regularly updated by the project’s stakeholders. The emerging models are highly structured, and instance files entail large amounts of data. However, in an unprocessed state, these models are of limited suitability for performing engineering tasks as the amount and structure does not match the domain-specific and purpose-oriented views. Methods Selection and filtering data for the user’s needs is a well-understood task in computer science, and various approaches are available. A promising approach is the usage of formal query languages. In this paper, selected common query languages are examined and assessed for processing building model information. Based on the analysis, we come to the conclusion that textual query languages are too complex to be employed by typical end users in the construction industry such as architects and engineers. Results To overcome this issue, two Visual Programming Languages representing a new, more intuitive mechanism for data retrieval are introduced. The first one, QL4BIM, is designed for general filtering of IFC models, the second one, VCCL, has been developed for Code Compliance Checking. Both languages provide operators based on the Relational Algebra to allow handling of relations - a highly required feature of BIM QLs. Conclusions The paper concludes with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of visual programming languages in the BIM context.},

The existing problems, good practices, and suggestions by users are described to improve the procedures of the Register of Buildings as a tool or the services of procedures supported by it, which is advisable to take into account by the register’s owner in the organization of further developments. The second chapter of the report describes the vision of what kind of tool could be the procedural system of the Register of Buildings be in the future. The vision for the future describes the steps to be digitalized, including an alternative process flow as an innovation for applying for notifications and permits using an information model that would allow faster course of the process. In addition, future vision processes, data flows, and conceptual data views are described. As an addition, complementing requirements for the product development have been described which further convey the requirements that have become apparent during the work, the conveying of which was not practical with the final prototype or the aforementioned descriptions. In order to simplify future procedures, checklists were prepared for the case handlers in cooperation with the competent authorities, which is an internal tool for the Register of Buildings in carrying out future procedures. The suggested practices and measures that the case handlers could apply to carry out procedures to ensure a more efficient procedure were also described. The third chapter of the report carries out an impact analysis as a qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the impact of the implementation of the future vision (including the new EHR user interface, new processes, and compliance with best practices described) on the case handlers and other competent authorities. The analysis found that, if the procedural volumes of the year 2018 are taken as the basis, the implementation of the future vision saves working time for the competent authorities in the amount of at least 45 FTEs per calendar year.},

  abstract = {Digital and intelligent buildings are critical to realizing efficient building energy operations and a smart grid. With the increasing digitalization of processes throughout the life cycle of buildings, data exchanged between stakeholders and between building systems have grown significantly. However, a lack of semantic interoperability between data in different systems is still prevalent and hinders the development of energy-oriented applications that can be reused across buildings, limiting the scalability of innovative solutions. Addressing this challenge, our review paper systematically reviews metadata schemas and ontologies that are at the foundation of semantic interoperability necessary to move toward improved building energy operations. The review finds 40 schemas that span different phases of the building life cycle, most of which cover commercial building operations and, in particular, control and monitoring systems. The paper’s deeper review and analysis of five popular schemas identify several gaps in their ability to fully facilitate the work of a building modeler attempting to support three use cases: energy audits, automated fault detection and diagnosis, and optimal control. Our findings demonstrate that building modelers focused on energy use cases will find it difficult, labor intensive, and costly to create, sustain, and use semantic models with existing ontologies. This underscores the significant work still to be done to enable interoperable, usable, and maintainable building models. We make three recommendations for future work by the building modeling and energy communities: a centralized repository with a search engine for relevant schemas, the development of more use cases, and better harmonization and standardization of schemas in collaboration with industry to facilitate their adoption by stakeholders addressing varied energy-focused use cases.},

  abstract = {The presented work discusses the potential application of ontologies for design automation in the building automation field. It relates to an ongoing implementation and related prototype being developed by an automation systems provider. Modern buildings have complex technical equipment which is hard to operate efficiently from a user’s point of view. Optimal commissioning and operation of building energy systems necessitate complex design and configuration of building automation and control systems (BACS). Generally, a BACS supplier or installer uses its own software system and customized monitoring databases. The presented approach tries to automate BACS setup relying on semantic modeling and knowledge reuse. It shall support the design and configuration of complex BACS systems by the means of automated characterization of the underlying building energy system and inferring of its most adapted control systems and strategies. For that purpose, it makes use of ontologies for modeling the topology of energy systems as well as emulating the knowledge of BACS design experts. Indeed, automation providers have much expert knowledge and experience in the design, evaluation and commissioning of energy system controls. It is investigated whether this manufacturer expertise can be represented via knowledge representation and model parameterization. A workflow is proposed that shall make it possible to support automated BACS design relying on a formalized description of HVAC systems from a wide variety of application fields using a generic templates library. For this purpose, existing energy systems are examined with regard to various structural properties such as topology, energy flows and control loop structures as well as needed sensors and monitoring functions. It is taken into account that the energy supply of buildings is planned individually to a high level of detail due to different system requirements. Therefore, an automated design of control systems requires the limitation and classification of possible system configurations. Knowledge about control concepts and controller architectures of distributed energy systems is required for the automatic generation of control architectures. This knowledge must be collected, systematized and stored appropriately. At the beginning, relevant controller concepts and controller architectures for the application in the targeted energy system are selected and described. A component library contains models for controllers and energy system components as well as buildings and plant models. For this purpose, it is necessary to create tools that allow the semi-automatic generation and testing of such components from the library. A prototype is being implemented inside design software of IFM automation solutions provider in cooperation with Fraunhofer.},

  abstract = {"Ontology-based Building Energy System Commissioning and Monitoring": Commissioning and operating building energy systems necessitates much configuration and testing work of the building monitoring and automation system. Generally suppliers and installers use singular proprietary software systems and customized monitoring databases. Once setup and in operation, there is also no guarantee that the building is energy-efficient and most of time building users themselves act as energy wasting factors due to their wrong usage of the building energy system. As a response, the presented work aims at developing an expert system that shall ease the transition between design and operation as well as provide live recommendations for a continuous commissioning of the building energy system. For that purpose, it relies on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web technologies. The presented approach tries then to bring a complementary added value to classical building automation and control systems (BACS) by the means of semantic modeling and knowledge reuse for semantic analysis and characterization of the building energy system and its operational conditions. For that purpose, it implements a knowledge base of energy conservation measures and potential operating errors that prescribe energy-efficiency actions and handlings to building users or a facility managers. The system consumes for a part building data gathered during its operation through a monitoring system. For another part, it relies on metadata contained in initial BIM-compliant building design models. The resulting software application might be used in the future as an add-on to existing building management systems (BMS). Modern BMS are able to handle a huge amount of data that are analyzed for supervising, controlling and benchmarking buildings. BMS data are mainly gained through sensors and meters that provide information about e.g. the operational state of technical equipment, indoor temperature or energy consumption. Because of its highly time-dependent nature, this kind of information can be categorized as dynamic data about a building in contrast to static data which represent the building and its technical systems as they are i.e. as built physical entities. This latter kind of information encompasses data about the energy system components, their technical characteristics and their layout in the building. Even if numerous dynamic data are produced during building operation there is no much use of building static information created during its design. In view of that, the proposed methodology aims at closing this informational gaps between building design and operation by making reuse of initial design models serialized in IFC. The intrinsic relationships between dynamic and static data are then represented into some ontologies and analyzed by means of logical reasoning. In existing BMS those relationships are semantically poor and only contained partially in the backend data model of the BMS, like a relational database in most cases. The proposed semantic building information model is then used for interpreting building energy system behaviors and identifying best energy conservation measures. More specifically, an energy system ontology together with a risk ontology are introduced to support reuse of knowledge for optimized building operation.},

Users and building managers therefore need guidance in terms of finding the most efficient operational strategies and monitoring plans to avoid faults and energy wastes. Current support systems can do that, but they must usually be adapted to each building manually. In this study, an expert system is proposed that provides a complementary analysis layer with semantic modeling and knowledge reuse. During the configuration phase, the system starts from a semantic description of a building energy system to identify potential efficiency risks and automatically apply generic monitoring functions and rules for building operation. In the operational phase, it generates advices based on continuous real-time analysis of building operational data. The current implementation of the expert system in 14 buildings proved that the approach can allow for a deployment on a larger scale.},

Motivated by continuing sub-optimal health and safety management processes, the research employs a conceptual framework rooted in construction guidance: structuring data via a 7-stage ontology to improve designer knowledge of issues and give access to an expanding safety knowledge base (the BIM Safety Risk Library). The tool facilitates tacit and explicit knowledge sharing in visual environments, enabling the construction industry to benefit from their health and safety data while providing an interactive learning tool for designers. The structuring of data also opens up possibilities for other digital advances (e.g. via automatic rule checking).}

  abstract = {Retrieving queried information from building information models (BIM) requires experience in structured query languages and manipulation of BIM software. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based spoken dialogue systems provide more opportunities for information retrieval from building information models via natural language queries. This research developed a transfer learning-based text classification (TC) method to classify different queries into pre-defined categories for an intelligent building information spoken dialogue system (iBISDS), a virtual assistant that provides information retrieval support for construction project team members. The architecture of the TC neural network (NN) was built based on the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). After the training process, the re-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa NN achieved a precision of 99.76\%, a recall of 99.76\%, and an F1 score of 99.76\% on the testing dataset. The experimental results indicated that the developed NN algorithm for TC can relatively accurately classify different building information-related queries into pre-defined TC categories.}

However, integrating multisource safety risk factors and text-based rules remains a challenge. This study proposes a semantic approach to integrate heterogeneous data under a building information modeling (BIM) environment and enable automated safety checking through SPARQL-based reasoning. In this framework, four interconnected ontologies are developed to provide a semantic schema for subway construction safety checking. Safety risk factors data are extracted from BIM and sensor data and then converted into integrated ontology instances. Text-based rules are automatically transformed into SPARQL-based checking rules. The proposed framework can improve knowledge sharing and promote real-time and automated safety checking. A case is illustrated to show how the framework can be applied, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

A CDE that engages all stakeholders of the building's design, construction, and operation phases represents the outset of BIM maturity level 3. This article introduces a CDE called Virtual Commissioning (VC), capable of commissioning an HVAC system before the physical commissioning of the HVAC system. The FSC diagram is introduced, to represent an HVAC BIM model within the VC CDE, and the Revit to FSC exporter, to serialize an HVAC object model from Revit to the FSC diagram. Three microservices were developed to exemplify the ease of developing independently scalable solutions for the VC CDE. Furthermore, the article proves that Modelica simulations can be run, using the microservice architecture of the CDE. To test the robustness of the system architecture for the CDE, two example models were introduced, one simple and one with a high level of complexity. Transferring the example models from Revit to the VC CDE was successful. Finally, in the roadmap for future development, it is proposed that future work should focus on using the CDE for advanced hydraulic simulations, using Modelica and Spawn-of-EnergyPlus.}

However, there still exists semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts, hindering the exploitation of ARC. Thus, a knowledge-informed framework for improved ARC is proposed based on natural language processing. Within the framework, an ontology is first established to represent domain knowledge, including concepts, synonyms, relationships, constraints, etc. Then, semantic alignment and conflict resolution are introduced to enhance the rule interpretation process based on predefined domain knowledge and unsupervised learning techniques. Finally, an algorithm is developed to identify the proper SPARQL function for each rule, and then to generate SPARQL-based queries for model checking purposes, thereby making it possible to interpret complex rules where extra implicit data needs to be inferred. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods successfully filled the semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts with domain knowledge, which achieves a 90.1\% accuracy and substantially outperforms the commonly used keyword matching method. In addition, the proposed rule interpretation method proves to be 5 times faster than the manual interpretation by domain experts. This research contributes to the body of knowledge of a novel framework and the corresponding methods to enhance automated rule checking with domain knowledge.},

  abstract = {Unsafe construction behavior, one of the leading factors of accidents and casualties, can be reduced by strengthening construction inspection. However, current methods use either manual inspection or inefficient cross-modal models based on multiple backbone networks. To alleviate the problems, a “rule-question” transformation and annotation system is formulated, and the unsafe behavior detection is turned into a visual reasoning task: visual question answering (VQA). The VQA model is developed based on a vision-and-language Transformer, and the unsafe behavior could be identified based on the output answers. A dataset containing 16 safety rules and 2386 related construction images is used to fine-tune and validate the VQA model. The results show that the developed VQA model achieves an average recall of 0.81 at a faster reasoning speed. Finally, an applet for safety report generation is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the safety compliance checking based on VQA.}

In practice, this process is conducted manually or semi-automatically for each element, which is time-consuming and relies on engineers' knowhow and experience for buildability improvement, material savings and clash resolution. This paper presents an automated pipeline for clash-free rebar design optimization integrating graph neural networks (GNN) and exploratory genetic algorithms (EGA). Graph representation is adopted to characterize rebar layouts in both structural elements and different kinds of reinforced concrete joints. GNN leverages graph representation of rebars to consider the parametric relationship between different rebar groups in a single structural element or among multiple structural elements, enhancing the efficiency of clash-free rebar design optimization. EGA supports design checking and further optimization according to building codes to achieve the optimal design. Compared with conventional optimization methods, the proposed pipeline can automatically identify optimal clash-free rebar design in compliance with code-stipulated requirements while reducing 75\%–90\% of the computation time, which shows enormous potential for practical use in the industry.}

This study proposes an automatic BIM detailing method based on deep features (DFs) of BIM 3D views in three steps. First, a BIM's 3D view and semantics were extracted automatically. Then, machine learning (ML) algorithms learned the DFs to predict the target BIM's invisible details. Finally, the details were automatically added to BIM by a Dynamo program. A case study of motion-bearing component detailing for 86 doors through three DFs and five ML algorithms revealed that DFs improved the automatic detailing results comprehensively (29 out of 32 scenarios) and significantly. This paper's contribution includes an effective, novel approach for automatic BIM detailing as well as quantified experimental evidence about the effectiveness of DFs for BIM applications.}

  abstract = {Abstract In the last decade, the paradigm Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM) was investigated to exploit the possibilities offered by the application of BIM to historical buildings. In the Cultural Heritage domain, the BIM-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a workflow that exploits the advantages of BIM platforms and Semantic-Web technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of semantically structured and rich HBIM data. The presented pipeline follows four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and, later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model, providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with appropriate LOD and Grade in BIM environment and then guarantee a complete interoperability with IFC/RDF format. Relying on semantically structured data (ontologies) and on the Linked Data stack appears a valid approach for addressing existing information system issues in the CH domain and constitutes a step forward in the management of repositories and web libraries devoted to historical buildings.},

Malfunctions of electro-mechanical equipment or the associated control function result not only in incorrect operation, but also wastage of energy. Automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) of processes like heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) is a challenging task due to the diversity of the applications and inter-dependencies between the equipment. Semantic description of the building and its equipment can help AFDD agents to better understand the system and continuously examine its operation. However, AFDD using only the structural description of the building topology and the contained equipment without relating it to the control functions requires manual verification of the root cause. In this work, we added a model of the control functionality to the semantic information of the structural and topological description and represented it using W3C Web of Things Thing Descriptions. Based on these descriptions, we have demonstrated in a case study of a building installation that fault detection rules which have access to the semantic description of underlying control functions can be formulated more precisely and thereby avoid false positives.},

The devices used in Building Automation (BA) systems have different functional and non-functional requirements, and this leads to a heterogeneous system with vertical silos where multiple standards are at play along with vendor-specific information models and implementations. In such a situation establishing technical and semantic interoperability is challenging. Also, the absence of a method to uniformly represent entities across verticals and functional layers in BA, makes it difficult to link them to knowledge graphs that describe the building and its physical processes. The W3C Web of Things (WoT) aims to address this (and related) issues in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Based on our experience with a real-life implementation in the industry, we demonstrate how the challenge of creating uniform interface descriptions for the vast and heterogeneous BA standards landscape can be be overcome using WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs), and further, we show how such TDs can be linked to knowledge graphs by facilitating their integration in the engineering workflow. As a concrete use case, our demo shows how an automated fault detection system which we developed for room automation controls uses the TDs to reason about the physical process and its control programs and then retrieves process data for its analysis.},

  abstract = {In the last years, several ontologies focused on structuring domain-specific information within the scope of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) have emerged. Several of these individual ontologies redefine core concepts of a building already specified in the publicly available ontology ersion of the ISO standardised Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema, thereby violating the W3C best practice rule of minimum redundancy. The voluminous IFC schema with origins in a closed world assumption is likewise violating this rule by redefining concepts abou time, location, units, etc. already available from other sources, and it is furthermore violating the rule of keeping ontologies simple for easy maintenance. Based on all the available ontologies, we propose a simple Building Topology Ontology (BOT) only covering the core concepts of a building, and three methods for extending this with domain-specific ontologies. This approach makes it (1) possible to work with a limited set of core building classes, and (2) extend thoses as needed towards specific domain ontologies that are in hands of business professionals or domain-specific standardisation bodies, such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), buildingSMART, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and so forth.},

  abstract = {Dimensional variability of components and assemblies in construction can lead to significant defects, rework, and project risk if not managed effectively. Given the complexity of using tolerance management to control dimensional variability, an automated BIM-based approach is highly propitious, while currently elusive. This paper develops the first iteration of a domain model for tolerance management (ToleranceDM) using two case study examples within the domain of building construction. The results are shown to (1) consolidate the scattered, disparate existing “knowledge” and research on tolerance management into a single standardised, uniform framework, and (2) formalise this knowledge so that it can be unambiguously interpreted and parsed into software systems for automated tolerance management in construction. ToleranceDM functions as a key step towards benchmarking process capabilities, computing tolerance compliance automatically, and enabling in-field communication of tolerance requirements. Future research should explore case studies in different construction domains, along with developing an improved abduction framework and integrating as-built project data for tolerance compliance checking.}

In DISPONTE, the axioms of a knowledge base can be annotated with a set of variables and a real number between 0 and 1. This real number represents the probability of each version of the axiom in which the specified variables are instantiated. In this paper we present the algorithm BUNDLE for computing the probability of queries from DISPONTE knowledge bases that follow the \$\textbackslash mathcal\{ALC\}\$semantics. BUNDLE exploits an underlying DL reasoner, such as Pellet, that is able to return explanations for queries. The explanations are encoded in a Binary Decision Diagram from which the probability of the query is computed. The experiments performed by applying BUNDLE to probabilistic knowledge bases show that it can handle ontologies of realistic size and is competitive with the system PRONTO for the probabilistic description logic P-\$\textbackslash mathcal\{SHIQ\}\$(D).},

Ontologies are stored in a relational database, using a description logic reasoner to pre-compute the class and property hierarchies and to obtain all the ontology information (i.e. properties domain and range) which is also stored in the database. Furthermore, a simple but expressive query language has been implemented, which allows us to query and reason on these ontologies. In order to show the use of the tool, we present an example that generates a relational database to store the Univ-Bench ontology. Finally, in order to asses the performance of our tool, we use LUMB, a well known benchmark to compare repositories in the Semantic Web extending it with more complex queries, and we compare the results obtained with Minerva.

This paper outlines the approach of integrating a synthetic distribution network tool (RNM-US) with URBANopt™, a modular and customizable software development kit for thermal and electrical modelling of buildings and energy systems at a district scale. First, we describe the algorithms implemented to integrate RNM-US with URBANopt to automatically generate the distribution network for the district considered. Following, we present a case study for the potential uses of the RNM-US integrations with URBANopt, highlighting the capabilities for economic and technical analysis of the distribution network built in relation to the electricity needs of the modelled buildings.}

  abstract = {Semantic enrichment of building models adds meaningful domain-specific or application-specific information to a digital building model. It is applicable to solving interoperability problems and to compilation of models from point cloud data. The SeeBIM (Semantic Enrichment Engine for BIM) prototype software encapsulates domain expert knowledge in computer readable rules for inference of object types, identity and aggregation of systems. However, it is limited to axis-aligned bounding box geometry and the adequacy of its rule-sets cannot be guaranteed. This paper solves these drawbacks by (1)~devising a new procedure for compiling inference rule sets that are known a priori to be adequate for complete and thorough classification of model objects, and (2)~enhancing the operators to compute complex geometry and enable precise topological rule processing. The procedure for compiling adequate rule sets is illustrated using a synthetic concrete highway bridge model. A real-world highway bridge model, with 333 components of 13 different types and compiled from a laser scanned point cloud, is used to validate the approach and test the enhanced SeeBIM system. All of the elements are classified correctly, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach to semantic enrichment.},

Automated rule extraction is a challenging task that requires complex processing of text. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the first step in automating the rule extraction process is automatically classifying the different documents and parts of documents (e.g.,~contract clauses) into predefined categories (environmental, safety, health, etc.) for preparing it for further text analysis and rule extraction. These categories are defined in a semantic model for normative reasoning. This paper presents a semantic, machine learning-based text classification algorithm for classifying clauses and subclauses of general conditions for supporting ACC in construction. The multilabel classification problem was transformed into a set of binary classification problems. Different machine learning algorithms, text preprocessing techniques, methods of text feature scoring, methods of feature weighting, and feature sizes were implemented and evaluated at different thresholds. The developed classifier achieved 100 and 96\% recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The trend of increased usage of both BIM and 3D GIS and the similarity between the two has led to an increase in the overlap between them. A key application of such overlap is providing geospatial context data for BIM models through importing 3D GIS-data to BIM software to help in different design-related issues. However, this is currently difficult because of the lack of support in BIM software for the formats and data models of 3D Geo-information. This paper deals with this issue by developing and implementing a methodology to convert the common open 3D city model data model into the most common open BIM data format, namely CityGML (Gröger et al., 2012) to IFC (buildingsmart, 2019b). For the aim of this study, the two standards are divided into 5 comparable subparts: Semantics, Geometry, Geographical coordinates, Topology, and Encoding. The characteristics of each of these subparts are studied and a conversion method is proposed for each of them from the former standard to the latter. This is done by performing a semantic and geometrical mapping between the two standards, converting the georeferencing from global to local, converting the encoding that the two standards use from XML to STEP, and deciding which topological relations are to be retained. A prototype implementation has been created using Python to combine the above tasks. The work presented in this paper can provide a foundation for future work in converting CityGML to IFC. It provides an insight into the relationship between the two standards and a methodology for the conversion from one to the other, and the process of developing software to perform such conversion. This is done in a way that can be extended for future specific needs.},

In recent years, digital transformation is promoting new operational methods for Facility Management (FM) with the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems. The research proposes a method supported by BIM tools to improve maintenance processes in terms of efficiency, quality and speed. The method consists of the integration of Building Condition Assessment (BCA) with Building Information Modeling (BIM) in order to collect, digitize and evaluate the physical and performance conditions of assets to improve management and maintenance processes. The results show two procedures for data collection and integration into the BIM model. The first procedure uses mobile devices and Excel spreadsheets as databases imported into the BIM model through a Visual Programming Language (VPL). The second procedure uses a system of Common Data Environmental (CDE) that capture data from on-site monitoring sensors and link them to the BIM model. The case studies concern an existing building of historical and cultural value, the Brunelleschi's Cloister, and a viaduct belonging to a road infrastructure.© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Despite the promising results of deep learning research, construction industry applications are still limited. Facility Management (FM) in construction has yet to take full advantage of the efficiency of deep learning techniques in daily operations and maintenance. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major part of Facility Management and Maintenance (FMM) operations, and an occasional HVAC malfunction can lead to a huge monetary loss. The application of deep learning techniques in FMM can optimize building performance, especially in predictive maintenance, by lowering energy consumption, scheduling maintenance, as well as monitoring equipment. This review covers 100 papers that show how neural networks have evolved in this area and summarizes deep learning applications in facility management. Furthermore, it discusses the current challenges and foresees how deep learning applications can be useful in this field for researchers developing specific deep learning models for FMM. The paper also highlights how establishing public datasets relevant to FM for predictive maintenance is crucial for the effectiveness of deep learning techniques. The utilization of deep learning methods for predictive maintenance on Thermal-Storage Air-Conditioning (TS-AC) in HVAC is necessary for environmental sustainability, as well as to improve the cost-efficiency of buildings.}

This paper presents six case studies of hospital design projects, where VR has been used with the purpose of involving end-users, investigating how and when VR has been implemented and which effects and experiences that could be noted. The findings show different levels of involvement, engagement, collaboration, and interactivity. Using VR contributes throughout the design process but is dependent on purpose and setup.

A proposed solution is to represent IFC data as an RDF graph and perform rule-checking using a rule engine. However, the generated graph has a complicated structure since it follows the IFC data model. Consequently, the definition of compliance rules can be challenging, and rules are sensitive to variations of input graphs structure. A methodology is proposed to optimize graphs by giving them a predefined or "standardized" structure. A case study shows that optimization allows the formulation of more straightforward and easier-to-write compliance rules, applicable to all standardized graphs regardless of the initially used BIM authoring tool. In addition, graph size is significantly reduced.},

One possible approach is to convert all data in a domain-independent format and link them together in a semantic database. To demonstrate, how this data integration can be done in a federated database architecture, we utilize concepts of the semantic web, ontologies and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It turns out, however, that traditional object-relational approaches provide more efficient access methods on geometrical representations than triplestores. Therefore we developed a hybrid approach with files, geodatabases and triplestores. This workin-progess-paper (extend abstract) demonstrates our intermediate research results by practical examples and identifies opportunities and limitations of the hybrid approach.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has brought great benefits to the construction industry by gathering all information in a project and making it available to the involved stakeholders. However, BIM has predominantly generated value in the design phase of a project, while the potential benefits in the construction phase have been disregarded for many years and are now gaining importance. Trending advancements try to utilize existing BIM data, e.g by linking a digital building model with planning efforts of the construction project and create new knowledge to improve construction. In this paper, we are interested in exploring how semantic models and Linked Building Data (LBD) can support value creation in the construction phase. The presented use case tries to answer the question how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by semantically describing and classifying TCIs in an ontology that allows to utilize TCI information with BIM data. TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the creation of an ontology in this field shall lead to a better and more automated consideration of TCIs in construction planning. Here, we follow the recommendation of the W3C - LBD community group to extend or develop new ontologies and propose the TCI ontology as the main contribution. We first introduce the TCI ontology and its relation to other ontologies. Then we demonstrate the value of the ontology by answering competency questions and finally provide a proof of concept of planning TCIs by utilizing the new ontology. The proposal of the TCI ontology is accompanied by a second ontology for Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) to consider the time dimension of planning. The main focus, however, lies on the development and presentation of the TCI ontology whereas the LBS ontology will be further developed in future research.},

  abstract = {For decades, the construction industry has experienced poor productivity due to challenges such as increasing project complexity and a fragmented project environment. Even though some technological innovations around Building Information Modeling (BIM) might have the potential to overcome these challenges, data integration across disciplines, companies and software solutions is yet to be solved entirely. Trending advancements try to enrich existing BIM data using Linked Data technologies to semantically describe the building information and facilitate data integration. By that, project data from different data sources is made available in an accessible format, so project participants can use it for their planning efforts. In this paper we explore the use of Linked Building Data (LBD) on a specific use case to answer the question of how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by integrating data and automating the demand calculation. A literature review concludes that TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the objective of this paper is to develop standard ontologies to provide a semantically rich terminology of the data and to propose a framework for TCI consideration within a BIM based project delivery system. A prototype solution is developed, taking formwork as a TCI representative. The result is a process for automatically creating a TCI utilization plan that quantifies the precise time- and location-based on-site TCI demand by integrating data from BIM, Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) and TCI information. Based on the results of prototyping and findings from expert interviews, this research integrates the solution into the process of construction and finally proposes two implementation scenarios for the solution – one being based on the current industry situation and one exploring the future vision of a more integrated and decentralized project delivery in the construction industry.}

As a result, we introduce a new process-oriented model that provides an improved basis for advanced process evaluation in the digital twin environment.

Tremendous savings can be achieved by deploying building management services during operation, however, the manual deployment of these services needs to be undertaken by experts and it is a tedious, time and cost consuming task. It requires detailed expert knowledge to match the diverse requirements of services with the present constellation of envelope, equipment and automation system in a target building. To enable the widespread deployment of these services, this knowledge-intensive task needs to be automated. Knowledge-based methods solve this task, however, their widespread adoption is hampered and solutions proposed in the past do not stick to basic principles of state of the art knowledge engineering methods. To fill this gap we present a novel methodological approach for the design of knowledge-based systems for the automated deployment of building management services. The approach covers the essential steps and best practices: (1) representation of terminological knowledge of a building and its systems based on well-established knowledge engineering methods; (2) representation and capturing of assertional knowledge on a real building portfolio based on open standards; and (3) use of the acquired knowledge for the automated deployment of building management services to increase the energy efficiency of buildings during operation. We validate the methodological approach by deploying it in a real-world large-scale European pilot on a diverse portfolio of buildings and a novel set of building management services. In addition, a novel ontology, which reuses and extends existing ontologies is presented.},

  abstract = {The digital transformation in the construction industry, which is also referred to as Construction 4.0, is gaining impact in recent years. BIM as the central point for model-based planning and communication is at the centre of this development. This paves the way for the implementation of further technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) or artificial intelligence (AI) in the construction process. However, the submission process currently receives little attention in the BIM project cycle, even though it has a significant impact on a building project. There is a huge potential for the application of BIM and AR in the building submission process. BIM allows partly automatic compliance checks to be performed. The BIM model and the results of these checks can be used as basis for the AR model. This paper investigates an application for AR in a BIM submission process. Here we show that especially the plan check process and hearings in the approval process can be improved and sped up by combining BIM and the visualization technology of AR. In this process, AR can support the building authority in checking the compliance with building regulations. Additionally, non-experts involved often have problems grasping the planned building project just based on the technical 2D plans. In this case, AR helps them to visualise the impact of the planned project and allows for better judgement. Use-cases are presented, showing strategies to improve the plan check process and assist the building authority as well as the persons involved, for both experts as well as non-experts. Finally, the requirements, technical implementations, and effects of an AR application for the plan check process are described. An AR-supported plan checking process can vastly improve the presentation of technical content. This leads to better understanding and more transparency for non-experts. Because AR is relatively easy to use, it might become ubiquitous not only to experts, but also to the general public.},

Although the BCF issues are spatially located in a model and provide links to building elements, the format is only loosely connected to the actual BIM model. While the format is well suited for its original use case, it lacks the flexibility to retrieve information from the BCF in conjunction with the BIM model. In this paper, we introduce the BIM Collaboration Format Ontology (bcfOWL), which translates the format to the Semantic Web and harnesses the expressive richness of OWL. We present the structure of the ontology and highlight the di erences with existing implementations of BCF. Using example queries, we show how extended relationships between a BIM model and BCF information are enabled by bcfOWL. We show that by transferring BCF to Linked Data, the format's applicability is enhanced without losing compatibility with existing implementations and workflows. In doing so, the ontology aims to integrate into the Linked Building Data environment and facilitates access to synergies between heterogeneous building data.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a widely established method in the architecture, engineering, construction, and facilities management (AEC/FM) industry. Although BIM focuses on processes throughout the lifecycle of the built environment, the applications in the planning phase, e.g. the generation of construction site layouts, have not reached their full potential yet. One important example herein is the allocation and dimensioning of resources (e.g., building materials and equipment) which is typically carried out by humans according to clearly defined rules and best practices. This paper presents model-based rule checking for the planning of construction site layouts. We demonstrate that existing Business Rule Management Systems (BRMS), such as the open-source rule engine Drools, can be used. We combine Drools with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to retrieve data from a building information model and use the information within the rule engine. We define general model requirements and implement a sample set of prototype rules. We also introduce the concept of offset geometry for rules that, for example, demand a known safety distance between temporary construction site elements. The developed approaches are explained and evaluated in field-realistic, practical case studies. Finally, we present a discussion how the application of the developed rule-based system may assist human decision making in tasks such as safe construction sites layout planning.},

This paper focuses on the research challenges regarding data management where the lack of interoperability is acknowledged as a key constraint for the wider uptake of Digital Twins. In ongoing research, a standardized approach of Asset Lifecycle Information Modelling (ALIM) is proposed to tackle the issues of data variety and uncertainties, big data repositories, and semantic data mining. ALIM facilitates the creation of Semantic Digital Twins (SDT) by capitalizing on Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies as well as open standardisation for modelling data across the lifecycle of building and civil infrastructure assets.

  abstract = {Unstructured and poorly managed information is a major cause of time delays in construction projects. Availability of relevant information at the required time has a considerable impact on decision making in the project’s lifecycle. Multi-models containers, and a more recent approach, Information container for linked document delivery (ICDD), aim to facilitate construction data management and sharing information. Containers help in structuring and linking of heterogeneous data. Such container models are relevant in and align with Common Data Environments (CDE) which facilitate a centralised environment for managing both information and services. Presently, three approaches fit in the vision of CDE: the DIN SPEC 91391-2, OpenCDE-API which is loosely based on DIN SPEC 91391-2, and the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), a generic data container-based approach to managing linked data graphs online. In this paper, we investigate how ICDD, an approach to link information, can be represented using the above three frameworks. A comparison is developed between the three approaches based on a sample use-case. The required conversion steps are analysed, and the limitations of the mapping are evaluated.

  abstract = {Common Data Environments (CDEs), which are crucial for ensuring data interoperability and reducing information loss during data exchange, use Information Containers to facilitate storing, retrieving, manipulating such information. While numerous efforts have proposed minimal conformance speciϐications for such containers, they don’t address container-based federated information management. Since AEC industry relies on information represented in different formats, these speciϐications are not applicable. As Semantic Web (SW) technologies provide mechanisms for linking such disparate information, this paper conceptualizes Information Containers by combining these SW concepts with existing AEC-CDE speciϐications. Developed from our earlier experiments, we propose an architecture for complex functionalities like metacontainers, container interlinking, maintaining link integrity, version management etc. It considers information as the primary source (data blobs), which are encapsulated in containers (considered virtual). Demonstrated by a preliminary prototype, this work’s main contribution is the conceptualization of Information Containers which uses speciϐications from existing approaches while accommodating interlinked data},

  abstract = {The project was funded by Business Finland and a consortium of 7 companies: Fira, Trimble, Bonava, Consolis, Parma, Ruukki, Sweco. Construction industry is suffering from low productivity, high risk of delays and cost overruns. Globally, productivity growth in construction has averaged only 1 percent a year over the past two decades, compared with the growth of 2.8 percent for the total world economy and 3.6 percent in manufacturing. At least 20\% of the total construction volume is waste, 30\% of con- struction is rework, 40\% of jobsite work is unproductive, 40\% of projects are over budget, and 90\% of projects are late (c.f. Forbes \& Ahmed, 2011). Typically this is blamed on the seemingly complex and chaotic nature of construction production. Complexity arises from the fact that currently no one has an accurate picture of what has happened and what is happening now, and there is a very unclear picture of what is going to happen in the future. The vision of the DiCtion project was to solve these problems by digitalizing construction workflows; All construction project stakeholders should have a shared understanding of past, current and future situation picture. The DiCtion project investigated various ways to achieve the shared situation picture. A key challenge that we explored was that different project stakeholders have their own view of the construction schedule because they are thinking in terms of their own work. In earlier attempts to resolve this, rigid approaches have been implemented, for example by forcing everyone to follow the same breakdown of work and locations. However, this rigid breakdown does not work well for any one of the parties and results in difficulties in updating information or adapting to changes. Our goal was to allow freedom of action for each stakeholder and to be able to combine the freely generated information into one, shared, project situation picture to enable collabora- tive planning. This required research and development related to developing underlying data models, creating the rules necessary for integrating information on a construction project level, enabling freedom and collaboration in planning future work, and finally finding out in real time what has happened before.},

However,  in  the  context  of building  engineering,  the  quality  of  the  graph embeddings could be problematic, mainly due to the relatively small size of the KGs that are created for individual buildings. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of applying KG embedding methods when the elements of the building are described narrowly within the KG. The results of our experiments confirm that proper use of data transformation techniques can significantly improve the quality of the feature representation for downstream tasks.},

Most of the studies on BIM-based construction safety inspection and prevention use data from the planning and design stage. Meanwhile, safety managers still need to spend a lot of time gathering reports about construction safety risks in certain periods or areas from inferred results in BIM. Therefore, this paper proposed an automatic safety risk identification and prevention mechanism for the construction process by integrating a safety rule library based on ontology technology and Natural Language Processing. An automatic inspection mechanism integrating BIM and safety rules is constructed, and a presentation mechanism of intelligent detection results based on Natural Language Processing is designed. The construction process safety rule checking system was developed, and the effectiveness of the system was verified by a case study. The outcome of this paper contributes to the development and application of ontology in construction safety research, and the NLP-based safety rule checking result presentation will benefit safety inspectors and construction managers in practice.},

It is of great significance to provide timely information and knowledge for safety risk decisions in prefabricated building construction, and to display this information visually. In response, based on the ontology theory and using the Revit software, in this study we aimed to establish a monitoring system for the construction of prefabricated buildings, which was verified through a practical case. The results revealed that, first, ontology technology can be applied in the Revit software through plug-in integration, and knowledge regarding construction safety risk management in prefabricated building construction can be shared, reused, and accumulated using this system. Second, problems with the design and construction models of prefabricated buildings that do not meet the specification requirements can be detected by the monitoring system in the Revit software. Third, automatic risk identification and response methods using ontology theory and BIM technologies can effectively promote construction safety risk management performance in relation to prefabricated buildings. These findings examine the application of ontology to the field of prefabricated construction safety risk management for the first time, enrich the research on ontology technology, and contribute to safety risk management in the construction of prefabricated buildings.},

  abstract = {This dissertation constitutes a study in the field of automated compliance checking, with a concentration on building code representations. Development of compliance checking systems has been an area of research that aims to provide computational support for accurate compliance checking of building projects against applicable building codes in a time and cost effective way. Systems for compliance checking of building projects require appropriate representations for building codes. Building codes are complex documents written in natural languages, and the development of computable representations is challenging. This dissertation proposes and demonstrates a new representation model and an accompanying modeling methodology for representing building codes in computable form that can be utilized in the development of automated compliance checking systems. The model adopts the four level representation paradigm as a theoretical base and uses the semantic modeling approach for developing the building code representation. The model breaks down the representation into four levels which allows separate modeling of domain concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules, and the organization of the building code. The dissertation shows that decomposing a building code into four levels and modeling rules based on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective modeling strategy for representing building codes in a computable form that is independent of automated compliance checking systems. The applicability of the model has been evaluated through a case study. The case study successfully illustrates the modeling of building codes that constitute parts of İzmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code, as well as a prototype implementation of an automated checking system utilizing this building code representation.},

Building codes are complex documents written in natural languages, and the development of computable representations is challenging. This paper presents a new model and an accompanying modeling methodology for the representation of building codes that may be utilized in the development of future automated compliance checking systems.

This hybrid model organizes the representation in four levels and allows for separate modeling of domain concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules, and the overall organization of the building code. The model is evaluated with a case study. The İzmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code is chosen as it is representative of complex building codes that are in effect throughout Turkey. The formalizable rules in the section of Izmir code that apply to all types of buildings, are represented in computer implementable format based on the new model. The research presented in this paper shows that decomposing a building code into four levels and modeling rules based on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective modeling strategy for representing building codes in a computable form.},

  abstract = {Safety planning in the construction industry is generally done separately from the project execution planning. This separation creates difficulties for safety engineers to analyze what, when, why and where safety measures are needed for preventing accidents. Lack of information and integration of available data (safety plan, project schedule, 2D project drawings) during the planning stage often results in scheduling work activities with overlapping space needs that then can create hazardous conditions, for example, work above other crew. These space requirements are time dependent and often neglected due to the manual effort that is required to handle the data. Representation of project-specific activity space requirements in 4D models hardly happen along with schedule and work break-down structure. Even with full cooperation of all related stakeholders, current safety planning and execution still largely depends on manual observation and past experiences. The traditional manual observation is inefficient, error-prone, and the observed result can be easily effected by subjective judgments. This paper will demonstrate the development of an automated safety code checking tool for Building Information Modeling (BIM), work breakdown structure, and project schedules in conjunction with safety criteria to reduce the potential for accidents on construction projects. The automated safety compliance rule checker code builds on existing applications for building code compliance checking, structural analysis, and constructability analysis etc. and also the advances in 4D simulations for scheduling. Preliminary results demonstrate a computer-based automated tool can assist in safety planning and execution of projects on a day to day basis},

  abstract = {Global energy concerns necessitate designing energy-efficient buildings. Many important decisions affecting energy performance are made at early stages with little information. Dynamic simulations support informed decision-making; however, uncertainty, high computational time, and expensive modelling efforts impair their use at early stages. This article develops an approach using building information modelling and machine learning that provides quick energy performance information. This approach has been implemented into a web tool, p-energyanalysis.de. It allows design space exploration, assesses the energy performance of design options, compares multiple options, performs sensitivity analysis, and tracks changes. Twenty-one participants (researchers and architects) used it as a support tool for designing an energy-efficient building. Their feedbacks are discussed as part of the tool development. The study found that the tool supports early-stage design decisions by quickly providing relevant information. The limitations, such as the bias in the results towards training data population and implementation issues, are also discussed.}

Even when metadata is available, it is usually poorly described, structured and linked to the corresponding data. In H2020 project InBetween, metadata description problem is approached by designing the project ontology on top of established ontologies BOT, SAREF and SAREF4BLDG. An approach for structuring and integrating all the collected data about occupants, their dwellings, appliances, sensors and locations into the project knowledge base is described. Building monitoring data, weather observation and weather forecast streams stored in SQL-based and time-series databases are semantically linked to the information about their respective source sensors stored in the knowledge base. Two data analysis use cases are discussed, along with improvements and benefits enabled by using the linked data approach. Discussed use cases are virtual occupancy sensor and electricity load profiling service. Linked data approach and use of common and standardized dictionaries help designing data analysis workflows that are easier to test, reuse and reason about.

  abstract = {This research reviews recent advances in the domain of Automated Rule Checking (ARC) and argues that current systems are predominantly designed to validate models in post-design stages, useful for applications such as e-permitting. However, such a design-check-separated paradigm imposes a burden on designers as they need to iteratively fix the fail-to-pass issues. Accordingly, the study reviews the best-practices of IFC-based ARC systems and proposes a framework for ARC system development, aiming to achieve proactive bottom-up solutions building upon the requirements and resources of end-users. To present and evaluate its capabilities, the framework is implemented in a real-life case study. The case study presents all the necessary steps that should be taken for the development of an ARC solution from rule selection and analysis, to implementation and feedback. It is explained how a rule checking problem can be broken down into separate modules implemented in an iterative approach. Results show that the proposed framework is feasible for successful implementation of ARC systems and highlight that a stable data standard and modeling guideline is needed to achieve proactive ARC solutions. The study also discusses that there are some critical limitations in using IFC which need to be addressed in future studies.},

However, most of the data in digital twins are unstructured—for example, specifications, reports, and other communication. These types of data dynamically change and incorporate a wide range of concepts with complex relationships. It is difficult to develop and maintain an ontological representation for such forms of data. This research work explored the use of concept networks as means to link BIM to unstructured data. Using topic modeling tools, a set of key terms are extracted from documents. The relationships between these key terms are investigated. A network of these key terms is established.

  abstract = {Automated rule checking has been identified as potentially providing significant value to the AEC industry from both regulatory and industry perspectives. Key challenges to a successful rule checking implementation are the complexities inherent in the rules themselves and the breadth of conditions to which they need to apply. Due to the large number of building codes and theoretically infinite number of rules that can be defined, it is critical to systematize the rules to make the task of rule checking tractable. This paper is a first step towards classifying automated rule checking. In this paper, the authors draw upon their extensive international exposure with various building codes and rule checking areas in the AEC domain to introduce a general classification of rules across application domains using criteria that apply to all known aspects of automated rule checking. The exposure covers both academic research as well as actual production implementation done with CORENET ePlanCheck project in Singapore, and also various pilot implementations in the US and other countries. The authors offer a survey of representative examples of different classes of rules, their key concepts, potential tools required to implement them, and at least one possible solution of each example rule in each category. The examples are drawn from both research domains and existing commercial applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial guide for creating a framework for rule classification that articulates both the process challenges and the technology needs to address rule automation.},

  abstract = {Specifications of the exact requirements for BIM-based rules are often much more complex than it appears from their direct language interpretation. It is because the complete rule interpretation involves knowledge from human experts. Therefore, detailed interpretation process of rules for the purpose of automated rule checking implementation must be able to capture such knowledge and it must be retained throughout the implementation process. In order to ensure both completeness and precision, the knowledge capture needs to be formalized. We propose a formalized way to capture these requirements using a knowledge representation approach. Detailed analysis of the structure of the rules points to the conceptual graph (CG) as a suitable method for this purpose due to its expressiveness, which allows unambiguous description of the requirements. Such unambiguous description can be understood by all the participants in the implementation efforts. The conceptual graph is a representation that conforms to the first order logic that makes it suitable for the job. Using the conceptual graph, rules can be broken into their atomic rules and incorporates the unwritten domain checking knowledge that if done right will remove ambiguities that often plague building codes. It also provides a standardized way to capture and document the model data requirements and the high level checking logic as their functional requirements. With this, a layer that often separates the rule experts and the implementers can be eliminated, resulting in clarity and immediate usefulness for the implementation. The validity of this assertion is demonstrated using the comparison to the actual corresponding implementation of the rules.},

  abstract = {The use of IFC as a standard format in exchange processes has been increasing as the industry begins to address the need of interoperability. A current problem with the use of IFC is in the quality of product models. Much effort has addressed this issue in the form of certifications to ensure a minimum quality of exchange requirements for an IFC file. However, even with the recent increasing awareness and effort to improve the quality of IFC files, the process is still too tedious, time consuming and requires manual efforts by experts. Even if those resources are available, there is currently no clear and quantifiable definitions of what exactly is a good quality IFC file. Without such measures, the adoption of IFC as standard exchange format will be hindered and the industry will be left with only restricted alternatives that are mostly vendor dependent. This paper sets out to address this issue in two aspects: first by defining what a good quality IFC model is, and second by proposing rules that can be automated to measure with confidence the completeness and correctness of the IFC model. These two aspects will serve as a starting point toward a more comprehensive and quantifiable measures of the quality of an IFC file. This proposed goal is represented by using well defined and well documented rules collected from various projects the authors had experienced over the years. The rules include all known aspects of IFC, including geometry, which currently requires mostly manual validation. The paper also proposes a method to address import validation that is under-developed compared to the export validation.},

  abstract = {Following decades of research, the potential of automated rule-checking applications for building models to boost the productivity in the AECO industry has yet to fully materialize. Most efforts have been dedicated to dealing with the complexities associated with formalizing rules related to building designs for computability. To make automated rule checking applications successful, data availability and accessibility are critical components that must be addressed. Unfortunately, to-date they have not received the same level of attention.  To lay a solid foundation for a robust environment of automated BIM-based rule-checking systems, this paper proposes a novel approach of transforming building data into a simplified schema (BIMRLSS) as a means of addressing this critical issue. The paper also describes an implementation of the proposed approach on a traditional database management system, which offers the primary advantage of facilitating high-performance queries and supporting a wide range of query types in real-time.  More importantly, this approach not only allows alphanumeric data queries, but also enables queries on the geometry by using various spatial operators. Allowing complex spatial-based queries provides a means to significantly simplify the traditional programmatic approach to BIM-based rule-checking. This data-focused approach allows us to lower a significant barrier that currently prevents BIM-based rule-checking systems from reaching their full potential, making the checking process easier and more robust. To highlight the implications and practical benefits of the proposed method, this paper also demonstrates several application scenarios by utilizing a wide range of queries.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an approach to extracting a predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models. For the computer to reason about the compliance of building design, design rules represented by natural language must be converted into a computer-readable format. The rule interpretation and translation processes are challenging tasks because of the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language. Many studies have proposed approaches to address this problem, but most of these are dependent on manual tasks, which is the bottleneck to expanding the scope of design rule checking to design requirements from various documents. In this paper, we apply deep learning-based NLP techniques for translating design rule sentences into a computer-readable data structure. To apply deep learning-based NLP techniques to the rule interpretation process, we identified the semantic role elements of building design requirements and defined a PAS for design rule checking. Using a bidirectional long short-term memory model with a conditional random field layer, the computer can intelligently analyze constituents of building design rule sentences and automatically extract the logical elements. The proposed approach contributes to broadening the scope of building information modeling-enabled rule checking to any natural language-based design requirements.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to describe a natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning-based approach for supporting automated rule checking system. Automated rule checking has been developed in various ways and enhanced the efficiency of building design review process. Converting human-readable building regulations to computer-readable format is, however, still time-consuming and error-prone due to the nature of human languages. Several domain-independent efforts have been made for NLP, and this paper focuses on how computers can be able to understand semantic meaning of building regulations to intelligently automate rule interpretation process. This paper proposes a semantic analysis process of regulatory sentences and its utilization for rule checking system. The proposed process is composed of following steps: 1) learning semantics of words and sentences, 2) utilization of semantic analysis. For semantic analysis, we use word embedding technique which converts meaning of words in numerical values. By using those values, computers can extract related words and classify the topic of sentences. The results of the semantic analysis can elaborate the interpretation with domain-specific knowledge. This paper also shows a demonstration of the proposed approach.},

Konclude’s reasoning core is primarily based on the well-known tableau calculus for expressive Description Logics. In addition, Konclude also incorporates adaptations of more specialised procedures, such as consequence-based reasoning, in order to support the tableau algorithm. Konclude is designed for performance and uses well-known optimisations such as absorption or caching, but also implements several new optimisation techniques. The system can furthermore take advantage of multiple CPU’s at several levels of its processing architecture. This paper describes Konclude’s interface options, reasoner architecture, processing workflow, and key optimisations. Furthermore, we provide results of a comparison with other widely used OWL 2 reasoning systems, which show that Konclude performs eminently well on ontologies from any language fragment of OWL 2.},

The motivation is that if most of the (query answering) work is delegated to the (usually) very scalable system ans1 while the interaction with ans2 is kept to a bare minimum, then we can possibly provide with scalable query answering even over expressive fragments of OWL~2~DL. We discuss the system’s architecture and we present an overview of the techniques used. Finally, we present some first encouraging experimental results.},

Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the current leading standard for BIM in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and ifcOWL is a Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation of IFC, which enables the interlinking of IFC models with other building and building related data that are also represented using RDF, such as devices, sensor data, geolocation, etc. IFC has a complex schema, designed to support parametric modelling in AEC and adherence to this schema is required to support importing IFC models into popular CAD tools such as Autodesk and ArchiCAD. Therefore, for those wishing to create ifcOWL models which can then be imported into these tools, a process of validation of the output must be done. In this paper, we present a method for validating ifcOWL models using SHACL which can be reused by anyone generating ifcOWL models and which returns a report highlighting any issues identified. The method is tested to validate the outputs of a conversion of geospatial data into IFC using a declarative mapping approach called R2RML.},

On top of compliance checking, this necessitates modeling concepts from regulations and enterprise operations so that stakeholder-specific and close to natural language explanations could be generated. We take a step in this direction by using Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules to model and map vocabularies of regulations and operations of enterprise. Using these vocabularies and leveraging proof generation abilities of an existing compliance engine, we show how such explanations can be created. Basic natural language explanations that we generate can be easily enriched by adding requisite domain knowledge to the vocabularies.},

  abstract = {The current three-dimensionally (3D) delimited property units are in most countries registered using two-dimensional (2D) documentation and textual descriptions. This approach has limitations if used for representing the actual extent of complicated 3D property units, in particular in city centers. 3D digital models such as building information model (BIM) and 3D geographic information system (GIS) could be utilized for accurate identification of property units, better representation of cadastral boundaries, and detailed visualization of complex buildings. To facilitate this, several requirements need to be identified considering organizational, legal, and technical aspects. In this study, we formulate these requirements and then develop a framework for integration of 3D cadastre and 3D digital models. The aim of this paper is that cadastral information stored based on the land administration domain model (LADM) are integrated with BIM on building level for accurate representation of legal boundaries and with GIS on city level for visualization of 3D cadastre in urban environments. The framework is implemented and evaluated against the requirements in a practical case study in Sweden. The conclusion is that the integration of the cadastral information and BIM/GIS is possible on both conceptual level and data level which will facilitate that organizations dealing with cadastral information (cadastral units), BIM models (architecture, engineering, and construction companies), and GIS (surveying units on e.g., municipality level) can exchange information; this facilitates better representation and visualization of 3D cadastral boundaries.},

  abstract = {Healthcare domain generates a lot of unstructured and semi-structured text. Natural Language processing (NLP) has been used extensively to process this data. Deep Learning based NLP especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT have found broad acceptance and are used extensively for many applications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word sequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically generates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are language models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical NLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity recognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure robust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and standardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can prove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are popular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture concepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest source of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing with an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and procedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best solution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs for the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same functionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant.},

Automated model transformation is challenging as semantic and spatial criteria need to be considered. This paper proposes a novel method and data processing pipeline to define space views and semi-automatically transform room-based building data created in BIM authoring systems into multi-view space models. The method is based on space ontologies and their integration with space layout transformation operations. It is used to define a set of functional views that are relevant to schematic building design. An existing space modeling system is extended with the method and data processing pipeline. Results from a validation study show that the method can cover specific semantic and spatial aspects of space views. Both are relevant for consistent model transformation and accurate analysis. Results further show that it is feasible to fully automate data processing steps, except for space classification, which is semi-automated.}

This supports the capability of evaluating a model against building codes or design rules to ensure that the building meets the relevant functional and safety requirements for occupants. However, building regulations are typically represented in natural language and, to date, they have not been created with regard to the digital BIM design process. To automate the design evaluation of a building model, this paper describes a simple, yet extendable, domain-specific language for computationally representing building interior design rules and a method for evaluating rules in this language against a BIM model. Furthermore, previous language-based model-checking approaches have not explored the applicability of their proposed languages beyond model-design evaluation. This paper demonstrates the use of our language in a second, more complex, use case, namely the automated generation of multiple valid alternative model interior designs, compliant to a set of design rules expressed in our language. We have evaluated the usefulness of our language in two generative-design case studies, namely kitchen layouts using a set of real-world kitchen design rules provided by an commercial partner, and living-room layouts using rules put forward in earlier automated-design research. Therefore, this research bridges the concepts of automated model checking and generative design relying on the same rule language.},

We achieve it using a framework to connect dynamic, context-aware, heterogeneous virtual and real entities on the Internet of Smart Meters (IoSM). We transform the smart electricity meters into fully-fledged intelligent computers on the IoSM and enable them to securely collect data from heterogeneous meters and sensors, detect smart meters with similar goals, exchange and aggregate data from multiple autonomous physical or virtual meters, and manage the actual energy demand and ensure the achievement of demand response for the community involved. Domain ontologies are used to store the semantics of the collected data from IoSM. A problem we have encountered is how our framework can use ontologies for community-grounded decision rules, which need to be consistent based on aggregation of collected data and contexts. We use Semantic Decision Table (SDT), which is a decision table enhanced with ontology technologies, to tackle the problem. This paper records our efforts in 1) the general design of the framework; 2) decision support models, namely SDTs, for fulfilling this requirement; 3) an algorithm of creating invocational SDTs; 4) the implementation of visualizing invocational SDTs.},

We illustrate the use of machine learning algorithms for semantic enrichment of BIM models, and compare it to rule-inferencing, through application to the problem of classification of room types in residential apartments. The results showed that machine learning is directly applicable to the space classification problem. Although rule-inferencing has succeeded in other contexts, it proved to be unsuitable for this problem. This leads to the observation that different BIM object classification problems require different approaches. More generally speaking, the AI methods used for semantic enrichment depend on the nature of the problem context, and future research will be needed to establish suitable guidelines.},

The EG-ICE International Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Engineering brings together international experts working on the interface between advanced computing and modern engineering challenges. Many engineering tasks require open-world resolution of challenges such as supporting multi-actor collaboration, coping with approximate models, providing effective engineer-computer interaction, search in multi-dimensional solution spaces, accommodating uncertainty, including specialist domain knowledge, performing sensor-data interpretation and dealing with incomplete knowledge. While results from computer science provide much initial support for resolution, adaptation is unavoidable and most importantly, feedback from addressing engineering challenges drives fundamental computer-science research. Competence and knowledge transfer goes both ways. \&nbsp;},

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web technologies are becoming more and more popular in the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) and Facilities Management (FM) industry to support information management, information exchange and data interoperability. One of the key integration gateways between BIM and Semantic Web is represented by the ifcOWL ontology, i.e. the Web Ontology Language (OWL) version of the IFC standard, being one of reference technical standard for AEC/FM. Previous studies have shown how a recommended ifcOWL ontology can be automatically generated by converting the IFC standard from the official EXPRESS schema. However, the resulting ifcOWL is a large monolithic ontology that presents serious limitations for real industrial applications in terms of usability and performance (i.e. querying and reasoning). Possible enhancements to reduce the complexity and the data size consist in (1) modularization of ifcOWL making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology, and (2) rethinking the contents and structure of an ontology for AEC/FM to better fit in the semantic web scope and make its usage more efficient. The second approach can be enabled by the first one, since it would make it easier to replace some of the ifcOWL modules with new optimized ontologies for the AEC-FM industry. This paper focuses on the first approach presenting a method to automatically generate a modular ifcOWL ontology. The method aims at minimizing the dependencies between modules to better exploit the modularization. The results are compared with simpler and more straight-forward solutions.},

The recent actions towards the development of an OWL version of the IFC schema (named ifcOWL) evidence the effort of facing the community request to specify IFC in an ontology language. This paper presents an enrichment of the EXPRESS to OWL conversion patterns with OWL class expressions that specifically capture certain constraints of the IFC standard. The presented class expressions can be used to improve the robustness of ifcOWL and support data integrity, consistency, and applicability across various scenarios of industrial application. In particular, the rules defining the relationships between non-abstract subtypes of IfcObject and corresponding subtypes of IfcTypeObject are analyzed and converted into novel class expressions. The proposed additions to the conversion pattern have been implemented into a software tool and the resulting ontology was tested against a use case to show the benefits of the new solution with respect to a basic ifcOWL. The novel conversion pattern enhances usability of the ifcOWL ontology by enabling its direct instantiation, without necessarily going through the intermediate generation of a STEP physical format that is then converted into an ontology.},

Whereas we have seen a strong technological shift with the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools, this second technological shift to the exchange and management of building data over the web might be even stronger than the first one. In order to make this a success, the AEC/FM industry will need strong and appropriate ontologies, as they will allow industry practitioners to structure their data in a commonly agreed format and exchange the data. Herein, we look at the ontologies that are emerging in the area of Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS). We propose a BACS ontology in strong alignment with existing ontologies and evaluate how it can be used for capturing automation and control systems of a building by modeling a use case.},

This paper demonstrates how an ontology can be used to encode construction regulations, acting as the single source for both human and machine readable regulations. The structure of the ontology will be described, along with how regulations can be encoded, and subsequently executed. This will be demonstrated on case studies using a proof-of-concept user interface that has been developed to abstract the generation of the ontological encoding.},

Objective: This paper proposes one of the possible implementations of a facility data model utilizing the concept of ontology as part of the contemporary Semantic Web paradigm. Method: The proposed facility ontology model was defined and developed to model all the static knowledge (such as technical vendor data, proprietary data types, and communication protocols) related to the significant energy consumers of the target infrastructure. Furthermore, this paper describes the overall methodology and how the common semantics offered by the ontology were utilized to improve the interoperability and energy management of complex infrastructures. Initially, a core facility ontology, which represents the generic facility model providing the general concepts behind the modelling, was defined. Results: In order to develop a full-blown model of the specific facility infrastructure, Malpensa and Fiumicino airports in Italy were taken as a test-bed platform in order to develop the airport ontology owing to the variety of the technical systems installed at the site. For the development of the airport ontology, the core facility ontology was first extended and then populated to reflect the actual state of the target airport facility. Conclusion: The developed ontology was tested in the environment of the two pilots, and the proposed solution proved to be a valuable link between separate ICT systems involving equipment from various vendors, both on syntax and semantic level, thus offering the facility managers the ability to retrieve high-level information regarding the performance of significant energy consumers.},

However, the way of encoding these requirements is subject to a wide range of possibilities, making it difficult for the users to choose the most suitable method. The paper presents a comparative analysis of methods to define IR based on document study and expert group discussions. The study covers Data Dictionaries (ISO12006), Information Delivery Manual (IDM), IFC Property templates, Information Delivery Specification (IDS), Level of Information Need, Model View Definition (mvdXML), and Product Data Templates (PDT), as well as other, non-standardised methods such as Linked Data with SHACL. The comparison is based on criteria from the review of use-cases and covers aspects such as value constraints, properties of fields, geometry representation, metadata, expressiveness and dependency. The paper concludes that no single method covers all the discussed aspects, and selection should be made consciously based on a purpose. The results are relevant to information managers to understand the relations and differences between IR methods, suggest standardisation bodies a way forward to harmonise, integrate or differentiate the standards, and provide a framework for evaluating IR methods.},

  abstract = {Introduction Climate change due to rising CO2 emissions is one of the biggest environmental challenges of the 21st Century. Achieving 20\% savings in energy consumption by 2020 through energy efficiency is one of the key measures to keep the CO2 emissions under control (EC ICT Report 2008). Intelligent, in particular, semantically enabled solutions for home or building automation and management, also referred to as Building Automation Systems (BAS) can offer significant contribution to energy conservation. Potential savings that may be achieved through smart control of heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems, lighting, etc., are estimated to 35\% (EC ICT Report 2008). In addition BASs provide advanced security and safety through alarm systems, leakage detection, fire detection and suppression, prevention of unlawful intrusions, and pollution reduction. The global market for such systems has a significant size and potential, with an estimated average annual growth rate of 5\%. Recent market research (Frost \& Sullivan, 2009) finds that the European building management and control system products market earned revenues of \$1.62 billion in 2004 and estimates this to reach \$1.84 billion in 2011 (Green Intelligent Buildings 2006). In Europe, the market is dominated by control box manufacturers and system integrators. Current BASs, however, offer limited intelligence commonly on the principle of on-off switching with scheduled or simple logic-based activation of the attached peripherals. To fully exploit the capabilities of the building automation systems for the purposes of advanced energy management, there is a need to integrate them with novel smart metering solutions, or Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) (ESMIG 2009), also referred to as demand side management (DLMS 2009). Advanced metering is a new approach towards the real-time energy consumption monitoring and supply optimization. AMI system connects advanced meters deployed at the customer premises with the information and control system at the grid operator’s side. The purpose of smart metering is to provide both energy suppliers and end-customers with the detailed knowledge of the temporal energy usage, the demand, at different levels of aggregation, such as consumption per apartment, per building, per residential area, etc. This information can facilitate demand prediction and supply planning and optimization, and can be a basis for adaptive energy pricing, and advanced applications of semantic techniques in bringing the energy related information to the users. The DLMS implementation today is bases for advance systems for meter readings such as (MESMET 2008) or (OSP 2008).  Regarding the impact that the energy usage information can have on the user behavior, a study (Darby 2006) has shown that a simple technology-enabled feedback to customers, based on a timely presentation of meter measurements can result in energy savings of roughly 3\% to 15\%. It is now increasingly important to understand how presentation of utility-related data, real-time consumption measurement and tariff, influences user behavior, and also how such data can be automatically used within a home automation system that acts on behalf of the user.},

Web of Data technologies - Semantic Web/Linked Data - can be used to interlink distributed building-related data with connections to activities, social networks, and business operations in buildings. IFC and Web of Data can have complementary roles in cross-model linking. IFC provides the ontology, detailed geometry, and existing export functions.

With visual information, these cameras support safety managers to identify the potential hazards and deliver prompt feedback. However, developing the surveillance camera plan remains challenging in considering the workspace of working at height activities and the dynamic nature of the construction site. This study proposes a camera installation plan considering different site layouts with time during the optimization to resolve this problem. An approach for Generating Planning for Construction Safety Surveillance Camera Installation in 4D BIM Environment, called SCI4D. The SCI4D comprises three modules: The site profile module (SPM), which extracts the spatial and temporal information from a 4D BIM; Parametric modeling module (PMM), which simulate cameras and calculate the performance of surveillance systems, Installation planning module (IPM) suggests the appropriate solutions that meet the requirement. The efficiency of the SCI4D approach is validated through the test of a building project of 3000 square meters. SCI4D determined 45 solutions with optimal coverage within budget, USD 2500. The contribution of the proposed approach is to proactively aid project teams in preparing surveillance plan that ultimately supports construction safety monitoring using vision intelligence.}

A total of 27 RFPs for housing, office, exhibition, hospital, sports center, and courthouse projects were analyzed to develop computer-interpreted RFP rules. Each RFP was composed of over 1800 sentences. Of these, only three to 366 sentences could be translated into a computer-interpretable sentence. For further analysis, this study deployed context-free grammar (CFG) in natural language processing, and classified morphemes into four categories: i.e., object (noun), method (verb), strictness (modal), and others. The subcategorized morphemes included three types of objects, twenty-nine types of methods, and five levels of strictness. The coverage applicability of the derived objects and methods was checked and validated against three additional RFP cases and then through a test case using a newly developed model checker system. The findings are expected to be useful as a guideline and basic data for system developers in the development of a generalized automated design checking system for South Korea.},

  abstract = {Public organizations responsible for building permits are increasingly considering the potential applications of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in their workflows, but BIM adoption still remains a complex challenge. This research aims to investigate the factors affecting BIM adoption for building permits through a case study of a public organization currently developing and piloting a BIM-based building permit process. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interview data revealed ten factors that influence BIM adoption for building permits: complexity (in both development and use) of a BIM-based building permit system; relative advantages/disadvantages of BIM for building permits; the existing building permit system; management support for a BIM-based building permit process; organizational culture; BIM awareness; training and learning; available expertise for a BIM-based building permit process; external pressure; and legal context. The findings are important for public authorities’ understanding of both the enablers and challenges of the BIM-based building permit process, and have practical implications for professionals in public authorities in particular, and also the Architecture Engineering Construction/Facilities Management (AEC/FM) industry in general, to guide their steps towards adopting BIM. This research also highlights the potential benefits of BIM adoption for the building permit process.},

  abstract = {Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) is a fragmented industry dealing with heterogeneous data formats coming from different domains. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is one of the most important efforts to manage information collaboratively within the AEC industry. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) can be used as a data format to achieve data exchange between diverse software applications in a BIM process. The advantage of using Semantic Web Technologies to overcome these challenges has been recognised by the AEC community and the ifcOWL ontology, which transforms the IFC schema to a Web Ontology Language (OWL) representation, is now a de facto standard. Even though the ifcOWL ontology is very extensive, there is a lack of detailed knowledge representation in terms of process and sub-processes explaining Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) for offsite construction, and also a lack of knowledge on how product and productivity measurement such as production costs and durations are incurred, which is essential for evaluation of alternative DfMA design options. In this article we present a new ontology named ifcOWL-DfMA as a new domain specific module for ifcOWL with the aim of representing offsite construction domain terminology and relationships in a machine-interpretable format. This ontology will play the role of a core vocabulary for the DfMA design management and can be used in many scenarios such as life cycle cost estimation. To demonstrate the usage of ifcOWL-DfMA ontology a production line of wall panels is presented. We evaluate our approach by querying the wall panel production model about information such as activity sequence, cost estimation per activity and also the direct material cost. This ultimately enable users to evaluate the overall product from the system. Keywords: Offsite Construction, IFC, Ontologies, Linked Open Data},

  abstract = {Managing infrastructure assets — street furniture, buildings, escalators, landing guidance systems, toilet doors — requires data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable: FAIR data. Making this happen is a huge challenge. But succeed and you get much more value from your assets. By optimizing the planning of maintenance work, Dutch rail infrastructure company ProRail managed to cut maintenance cost by 10\%. Data can yield enormous value but making them FAIR takes effort. In this presentation, we report some of the results of a small-scale proof of concept called SIDO and will demonstrate the core functionality of the solution we created. It shows that projects to make data FAIR can be small in scope and still yield immediate benefits. Thus, the FAIR data challenge can be met in a stepwise manner. The SIDO-case is about sharing data between parties that do work under ground. Better methods of sharing data make it possible to better coordinate planning. The result is that a street needs to be closed for digging only once, while multiple parties execute their maintenance work on their separate underground assets. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management took the initiative for the project and funded it, and it was executed with Evides, the water company of the Rotterdam region, and other parties that own underground assets in the same area. Together with CGI, we at Taxonic realized a solution based on free open-source components, delivering a prototype of a SIDO-cooperation space based on FAIR data. Data science techniques are promising, but creating FAIR data already starts yielding benefits even when more modest goals are pursued. FAIR data can lead to significant improvements in essential, basic primary processes where data science plays no role (yet). To introduce FAIR data in an organisation, small incremental steps can be taken, each with a solid business case. This is what the SIDO-case is about. Utility companies must be able to gain access to their equipment under ground. These works need to be coordinated to minimize cost and traffic disruption. There is a great potential for cooperation, and of course efforts are made to make this happen — in the past and present. But cooperation is easier said than done. Data about underground assets are sensitive and not to be shared irresponsibly. We created a FAIR data solution to support this. The essential ingredient of the solution is a semantic data model in RDF, including some OWL and SHACL. When asset owners publish data about planned works conforming to this semantic model, other asset owners can instantly see with whom they might cooperate when planning their works. We will relate the SIDO case to other real-world developments in the asset management domain where RDF-based solutions play a central role. Also, we will demo the functionality of the SIDO solution.},

  abstract = {With the current trend of using Linked Data to describe buildings during their entire lifecycles, the importance of product descriptions in a Semantic Web context is growing while most product ontologies are designed for mass-produced goods of little variance. But especially in the construction industry, products are often innovative and individually manufactured and previous attempts to depict them with ontologies failed to include meaningful alignments to already existing approaches. Thus, this paper gives an overview of existing product ontologies in general and analyses previous approaches in more detail to identify potential improvements that can be made. Based on this analysis, this paper presents the Building Product Ontology (BPO), including its concepts and alignments. To obtain a modular ontology, the BPO focuses on the non-geometric description without defining templates by determination of taxonomies and includes concepts to model assembly structures, interconnections of components, and complex properties and property values. The BPO enables manufacturers to freely model their products while still benefitting from the Semantic Web in respects of findability and availability of product data. By going through the given examples and demonstrations, inexperienced users are supported to apply the BPO and exploit its benefits.},

  abstract = {The exchange of construction-related data over the Web via Semantic Web Technologies is gaining interest in current research. However, most research focuses on non-geometric data, neglecting the description of geometry. While several methods to include geometry descriptions into a Semantic Web context exist, no uniform approach or general recommendation exists for the endeavour of describing building components in their entirety – including geometric descriptions –, leading to an increased suspension in applying Semantic Web Technologies in the construction domain. To therefore ease the description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits individual use cases. The identified approaches vary in their depth of the geometry description's integration into the Semantic Web and are subsequently studied regarding their overall aptness and characteristics in consideration of their application for future industry and research projects. In respect of the ongoing research in the field of the application of Semantic Web Technologies, not only in the construction domain, this article poses as an important foundation by giving a clear overview of existing implementations and relevant open research questions. Having this overview, the suspense for adapting to Semantic Web methods for describing geometries can be overcome by users more easily, while software developers can start to connect their clients' use cases to suitable approaches and related implementations to represent geometry in a Semantic Web context.},

Relation extraction provides an automated solution to extract relations that describe construction safety requirements from unstructured text. However, previous relation extraction efforts are limited in their extraction capabilities, representation, and automation. To address this gap, this paper proposes a deep learning-based method to automatically extract and represent relations that describe fall protection requirements. The proposed method: (1) uses a CNN-based model, with pre-trained word and position embeddings, to automatically extract domain-specific relations, and (2) represents the extracted requirements in the form of knowledge graph-based queries, which helps decompose complex requirements into manageable units while keeping these units connected in a scalable graph structure. The proposed method was tested on 20 OSHA sections, and has achieved 87.5\% precision, 83.4\% recall, and 85.4\% F-1 measure, which indicates good relation extraction performance.}

Further, many design changes are made to a building information model during design and construction phases, and it is difficult to extract and visualize the changed objects. Research on the use of ontology in BIM is also limited. The purpose of this study therefore is to use an ontology to visualize revised objects in BIM models. This research uses the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, a widely-supported open standard for building information models. The changed objects in the BIM model are extracted by comparing the revised model to the original model, and a model report of the design change is provided.

In this presentation, we would like to share our experiences using ontologies and DT for building comfort \& energy optimization. Firstly, a brief introduction to the Ontology Central will be made, which is an open-source Digital Twin Description Language (DTDL) ontology library for commercial buildings. Currently, three ontology models, namely the Foundation, Fire Alarm Systems, and HVAC Systems are provided and can be reused across buildings, systems, and services. Among them, the Foundation Ontology offers the digital common foundation layer for domain-specific ontologies and is motivated by several RDF ontology models e.g. Building Topology Ontology (BOT) and Brick. A pipeline that supports the conversion between the DTDL and RDF format is under development. Currently, a mapping between the Foundation ontology and the BOT ontology in perspective of space and asset is supported and will be presented. Afterwards, a smart analytic software service for building and its HVAC system called “HVAC Performance Analyzer” will be introduced, which deploys the Bosch ontologies and provides overall information about the building comfort as well as the system operation, based on the assessment of measured data. Several buildings of Bosch and its customers are on-boarded, monitored, and continuously managed by this service. Lastly, the successful deployment of the proposed ontology models as digital twin instances on the Microsoft Azure Digital Twin platform and corresponding analysis will be demonstrated. Smart building algorithms, called as Domain Expert Insight Models (DEIMs) for fault detection and predictive maintenance are developed. A proof-of-concept (PoC) study deploying the DEIM algorithm for energy optimization will be shown. Thanks to the DT and ontology models, the smart algorithms can be applied to other existing buildings without any modifications. The PoC study proves that DT plays a vital role in enabling scalable solutions to energy system optimization in the near future. One ongoing research of Bosch will be to onboard existing buildings with open-source RDF ontology and to enable further data analytics using semantic web technology. In summary, this presentation provides an overview of the development of ontology and DT applications of Bosch Building Technologies, which is believed to be invaluable to the facility management community.},

  abstract = {As thinking moves away from 3D visualisation towards information quality and speed of data exchange, [1], the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is seeking efficiency by the automation of checking. This study aims to examine the current quality of the checking in design, how it is controlled, and the adoption of automatic checking using rule-based checking software. It is based on the hypotheses that there is a need of automation which will improve quality; a need of a means to achieve automation and a need for understanding in industry. After investigation of quality in design, this paper poses three questions; first can a quality system be applied to automatic checking in design; second if the potential for rule-based checking is understood and utilised could quality be assured; and third can we identify the optimal balance between manual and automatic checking. Conclusion shows that AEC professionals have low confidence in the quality of design data; the current balance is heavily in favour of manual checking; and while the potential for automatic checking is known, its current utilisation is lacking, due to complexity, poor software support and lack of training. Alarmingly there is an indication that the majority dealing with automatic checking have no system of validation for new checking rules and only a minority had training in rule authorship.},

  abstract = {Rule checking for building designs has been universally acknowledged to have the tremendous potential to improve the quality and safety of buildings. Traditionally, it is viewed as a tool to assist the building code checking process. With the advances in BIM and its broad adoption in the past years, it is assumed that we are closer to the realization of an automated rule checking system for building designs with BIM as the enabler. BIM has brought us the integration of building information and its 3D intelligent objects into building models. It has bridged the gap between the theory, proposed in the 1970s, and the practice. With it, it is viewed that the task to develop an automated rule checking system becomes easier. However, despite many years of research and development in this area, we have not seen the progress we hoped to see. There is only one commercial application available today that is considered successful, i.e. Solibri model checker (SMC), and one turnkey implementation at the national level with CORENET ePlanCheck in Singapore. Even then, they have not really reached their full potential. Various research efforts have tried to address this issue. They focus on different aspects of the issues of rule checking. Some progress has been made, but the challenges stubbornly remain. In fact, the challenges actually increase with the rising popularity of BIM. No longer is it just about code checking compliance, but it has also widened to include all aspects of the building design, including the quality of building modelling, which is the focus of SMC, using BIM to improve the overall process of building lifecycles, specific domain best practices, etc. With such a wide range of requirements, an automated rule checking system appears to be still beyond reach. This research has ambitious goals, and focuses on looking for a holistic solution to the challenges of an automated rule checking system for building designs. This is a response from real world experience in implementing the CORENET ePlanCheck system and the subsequent development to improve its implementation, along with a fresh approach to the same issue with the rule checking initiative at Autodesk using Navisworks. The experience indicates that it is insufficient to address the issues with piecemeal approaches, solving one part of the issue while leaving the others open. The reason is that rule checking requires an integrated approach. An efficient software tool can only work efficiently in tandem with efficient access to the data. Likewise, the BIM data must be accessible for the checking to be performed efficiently, but the schema design needs to match the expectation for rule checking. Additionally, there is great complexity in dealing with 3D geometry and spatial queries that are often inseparable from building rules, and with the enormous variations of the rules. To approach this problem holistically, this research looks at the problem from the macro level and zooms into the micro level in a systematic and integrated manner. At the highest level, rules need to be classified into four different classes of complexity as viewed from their potential implementation. The classification considers major components needed to solve the problem and the high level identification of the algorithms needed. Through this exercise, there is a recognition that the complexity of the rule implementation relates directly to the complexity of the checking requirements and the concept of derived objects that involve higher level semantic concepts. For the higher level classifications, higher level semantics need to be supported typically by some kind of geometry and graph engines. Most rules including building codes can be addressed with support for up to class-3 rules. The increment of complexity between the classes is not linear and the chasm between classes can be wide. The first step of this research involves analyzing how to narrow the chasm and reduce the complexity, so that developing an automated rule checking system will be relatively easy with minimal development effort required, with the exception of very complex rules and those with very specific requirements. The second step in this research is to analyze various rules and break down their structure into a systematic and computable form. The suitable form of documentation is in a form of knowledge engineering known as the Conceptual Graph (CG). Using CG, various rules are analyzed and broken down into their basic concepts and the relationship between concepts. The CG will force the breakdown of rules into their atomic rules, the most basic form that identifies what really needs to be checked. At the same time CG is also very useful in capturing knowledge of the rules that includes entities, properties, their relationship and functions that operate on the entities. This may even include entities at the higher semantic level. The CG is an important step in the rule analysis or rule interpretation since if done properly it will remove ambiguity often found in building codes. At the same time the outcome can be mapped directly to the data model needed and the design for computer implementation. With the knowledge derived from the above two steps of analyses, three major components are identified to provide a backbone for an automated rule checking system that can simplify its implementation and use. All these three components represent the major innovations that this research advances, i.e. the use of a star-like schema to simplify IFC data for high performance queries, the approach to use multiple representations for geometry data, and a query-based extensible BIM rule language that allows simple to complex rule definitions. There are other minor innovations that this research also produces, i.e. a non-overlapping octree based spatial indexing for efficient spatial operations, and the methodology and format to capture rule requirements using the Conceptual Graph. The first major component is providing an efficient access to BIM data. While the IFC schema is good in facilitating data exchange, it is too complex for efficient queries of the data. The inherent tree-like hierarchical structure of the object based model in IFC and its select types make it hard to perform quick and dynamic queries. Therefore, this research explores an approach similar to the Data Warehousing concept that transforms building models from the IFC schema into a relatively flat, star-like database schema. This one way extract, transform and load (ETL) approach provides an optimized way to query the model. It essentially transforms the BIM data into a discoverable and query- able database. As concluded from the analysis of rule complexity, alphanumeric based data in the database is not sufficient to address the most useful rule checking requirements. This leads us to the second component that involves an integrated support for the 3D geometry and spatial operators to the geometry. A similar concept that has been successfully done in the mostly 2D GIS domain is adopted and extended for 3D geometry. In this approach both the alphanumeric and the geometry data now reside in the same database and can be queried together using a standard SQL. This brings a positive implication that the BIM data is now open and accessible provided that the geometry data can also be queried and standard spatial operations can be applied. Efficient queries can be achieved using a 3D spatial indexing based on Octree structure and multiple representations by denormalizing the geometry data into its basic and most often accessed data for rule checking. Finally, the third major component in the rule checking system is the glue to all the other components and concepts, i.e. a domain specific rule language simply named BIM Rule Language (BIMRL). BIMRL makes use of the query-able BIM data in the database that is integrated with the geometry and its basic spatial operators. It takes a form that is identified from the study of the rule structure that follows the form of a triplet statement: CHECK – EVALUATE – ACTION. It is built on top of an SQL interface, but it is simplified for a specific purpose: to capture building rules as simply as possible. The goal is to make rule checking to be easy to define and run, even by rule experts who are usually not programmers. The language inherits the power and flexibility of the relational concept that provides simple to complex queries almost always at will. In this way the language will become an analysis tool to be used to perform any type of check on the building model. Recognizing that it is not possible to have a language that can perform all imaginable rules, BIMRL is designed to allow for an extension using an evaluation function. The extension will facilitate rule checking that involves operations that are harder to perform or for specialized checking requirements and add them as component plug-ins to BIMRL. They can take advantage of the query capability and rule structure in BIMRL without changing the structure of the language itself. A software prototype has been developed as a proof that the concept is able to solve the problem of rule checking, which is what this research really aims to solve. The prototype involves the following capabilities: 1. The ability to query and check the building model without expensive and heavy technical or programming requirements. 2. The ability to perform checks on both the properties and geometry of the building model. 3. Flexibility that is built into the language to allow queries with open ended sets 4. The ability to perform class-1 to class-3 rules (at least part of class-3) without additional extensions). Using the prototype software, this thesis demonstrates how effective the approach is when it is applied to real-world building models (which includes the typical architectural, structural and MEP elements) using several representative rules. This prototype covers all the aspects discussed in this research, i.e. the database star-like schema, its ETL, 3D geometry support and its spatial indexing, the associated multiple representations, graph support in the database, and the BIMRL language parser and simple user interface with support for visual reporting using an open standard X3D format. This research demonstrates that the holistic approach to the automated building rule checking problem takes it closer to realizing the true potential of rule checking systems. The author believes that it can even serve as an analysis tool to provide a decision support system regarding BIM. With its accessibility by rule experts or even modelers, BIMRL opens up a lot more avenues for research and uses of rule checking and analysis on BIM data.},

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.},

Currently, the BIM focus lies on file-based collaboration, although with the rise of semantic web technologies, the benefits of web- and data-based collaboration for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry come within reach. A web-based AEC industry that relies on Linked Data can provide various advantages compared to ‘classic’ BIM practice, e.g. regarding interdisciplinarity, linking across domains and logical reasoning. In this paper, we investigate Linked Data rule checking mechanisms on decentralised building datasets. The recent Semantic Web standard Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is used to check a Linked Data building model that is hosted on multiple data pods. After a short introduction to Linked Building Data and rule checking approaches, a minimal distributed building model will be checked with basic SHACL patterns, generating a report to inform both end users and tools. In this case study, we make use of the Social Linked Data (Solid) ecosystem, a set of conventions and tools for creating decentralised applications.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the construction industry is rapidly catching up with the digital revolution that has boosted productivity in virtually all economic sectors. In current practice, the focus of BIM lies on exchange of documents, often through proprietary formats exchanged using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). However, with web technologies such as RDF, OWL and SPARQL, a data- and web-based BIM paradigm becomes within reach. The decentralisation of data and decoupling of information and applications will enhance a more general adoption of Big Open BIM, and is expected to lower the BIM threshold for smaller companies that are active in different phases of the building life cycle. Since one of the promises of the Semantic Web and Linked Data is a highly improved interoperability between different disciplines, it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel for the setup of an infrastructure that supports such a network of decentralised tools and data. In this paper, we evaluate the specifications provided by the Solid project (Inrupt Inc.), a Linked Data-based ecosystem for Social Linked Data. Although the exemplary use case of the Solid ecosystem is decentralisation of data and applications for social network purposes, we notice a considerable overlap with recent ambitions and challenges for a web-based AECO industry (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation). This includes standardised data representations, role- or actor-based authorisation and authentication and the need for modular and extensible applications, dedicated to a specific use case. After a brief introduction to Linked Data and its applications in the building industry, we discuss present solutions for building data management (Common Data Environments, multimodels, etc.). In order to translate these approaches towards a Linked Data context with minimal effort and maximal effect, we then review the Solid specifications for use in a construction-oriented web ecosystem. As a proof of concept, we discuss the setup of a web-service for creation and management of Linked Building Data, generated with the Solid-React generator. This application is envisaged as a bridge between the multiple data stores of different project stakeholders and the end user. It acts as an interface to a distributed Common Data Environment that also allows the generation of multi-models.},

Domain-specific collaboration platforms, the so-called Common Data Environments (CDEs), facilitate complex interactions between the various offices participating in a project. CDEs are developed and maintained by the large BIM companies allowing deep integration with BIM authoring tools. Notwithstanding the benefits such integration offers, usage of proprietary tools, data models and platforms holds the risk of a vendor lock-in and creates dependencies on platform APIs as the sole funnels trough which project data can be accessed - even when using open data formats. Recently, technologies for re-decentralising the Web are causing furore, as they allow decoupling data storage from applications. The Solid initiative bundles these technologies in a domain-independent way. In previous work we have already discussed data patterns for the AEC industry, using these technologies - the LBDserver. In this paper, we demonstrate how these very generic data organisation patterns can be aligned with common industry standards - facilitating compatibility with existing, centralised approaches while maintaining the benefits of organising digital projects in a federated way.},

However, this interest remains largely academic and has not sparked much adoption of web technologies in the field. To nourish adoption of Linked Data in practice, access to the data has to be made more easy. SPARQL, the recommended RDF query language, has proven very powerful for retrieving and updating RDF datasets. However, due to its verbosity and complexity, it is often considered a threshold for developers to implement in their tools. In this paper, we compare SPARQL with Linked Data querying languages that extend the GraphQL syntax, in context of querying building datasets: HyperGraphQL and GraphQL-LD. Since it went open source in 2015, GraphQL has been adopted by a large community of developers, partly due to its elegance and conciseness. As a use case, the queries are performed on an RDF-based multi-model that relies on the recent ISO standard ICDD (ISO 21597). ICDD interlinks information on a subdocument identifier level, based on OWL. It is aimed at the industry in that it adds a layer of Linked Data to documentation formats that are still widely used in practice: IFC, spreadsheets, imagery etc. Therefore, it is considered a tuned use case for comparing these different RDF query languages.},

Apart from their frequent use for as-planned buildings, BIM authoring tools have now been adopted for a number of years for digitising existing buildings as well, mostly by performing a ‘scan-to-BIM’ process: the creation of a BIM model, primarily based on point clouds. However, some inherent characteristics of existing buildings are complicating such a process: uncertainties, geometric irregularities, classification of heritage building components, linking sources about the real-world asset and an interdisciplinarity that may go beyond traditional Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) topics (e.g. heritage, Facility Management, sensor data and damage assessment). In this paper, a framework called ‘scan-to-graph’ (STG) is proposed to integrate the concepts of scan-to-BIM with Semantic Web technologies, as these could provide answers to the above-mentioned challenges, most notably on documentation of uncertainties, sources and modelling decisions, element classification and cross-discipline information linking. In order to test the STG concept, a use case was developed where the Audience Room of the Gravensteen castle in Ghent was reconstructed from point clouds, semantically enriched and stored as an RDF graph. The resulting graph contains multiple interlinked geometry types, metadata about the reconstruction process and the sources and allows to unambiguously refer to other contextual data on the Web.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has proven itself an extremely valuable asset for the construction industry, in terms of design, planning, rule checking and collaboration. However, a lot of fragmentation persists; each of the many stakeholders involved in a project has different methods and different software tools that need to exchange information. Conversion to standard exchange formats such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) enables such cross-domain communication only partly. Over recent years, the use of web technologies in the building industry has been gaining momentum, considered promising mechanisms for reaching a more interoperable BIM practice. Specifically, this relates to (1) cloud-based applications, and (2) Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies. Cloud-based initiatives for streamlining collaboration in building projects have known a long history. Spanning nearly two decades, they go from the (discontinued) frameworks in the early 2000s IMSvr (Hietanen, 2002) and BLIS/SABLE (BLIS-project, 2002; Kiviniemi et al., 2005) to the more recent and popular model server BIMserver (Beetz et al., 2010), and the recently introduced concept of “BIM bots” (van Berlo, n.d.). These projects are all based on collaboration and exchange through IFC. However, IFC only spans certain disciplines and offers limited interoperability with domains that are not covered in the schema. Such interoperability can be provided by adopting Linked Data technologies. The idea that the application of Linked Data concepts could seriously enhance interoperability and collaboration has been documented multiple times already (Beetz et al., 2005; Pauwels et al., 2017; Pauwels and Terkaj, 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2017), and several research projects are currently working on making Linked Data-based BIM more mature. With the use of the Linked Data standard RDF (Resource Description Framework)1 , it is possible to construct dedicated vocabularies for each related sub-discipline, connected with one another in a neutral format and without information loss. An additional advantage of such Linked Data vocabularies over traditional, monolithic, domain-specific information models such as IFC is their modularity, which increases the flexibility to address domain specific and local challenges. In order to combine both topics, the threshold for developing Linked Data applications needs to be lowered (Verborgh, 2018). Web applications need to communicate in an efficient way, to enable the interoperability and automation potential given by these technologies. The W3C standard for creating, querying and updating Linked Data databases is SPARQL. SPARQL has proven to be a very powerful querying language, but it is also known to be cumbersome and a threshold for developers that do not have a lot of experience with Linked Data triples. To overcome these issues, initiatives such as GraphQL-LD (Taelman et al., 2018) and HypergraphQL  rely on the API querying language GraphQL4, but extend it with Linked Data querying functionality, so it is possible to fetch the necessary data from the distributed RDF building model. The advantage of these initiatives is that no real Linked Data knowledge is needed to develop a service that makes nevertheless use of its core principles: GraphQL is flexible and clearly structured, designed to build client applications, their data requirements and interactions; the query response being structured according to the widely used JSON-format.},

This paper presents a software tool that aids in digitizing the control delivery process, spanning simulation during design to implementation and formal verification during commissioning. The tool can generate from Modelica models digital documentation of control sequences. This digital documentation, along with other project drawings and specifications can be used for project bidding. It can also be used for implementation of control sequences through machineto-machine translation to commercial legacy control products, for which we are currently developing the proposed ASHRAE Standard 231P based on the presented work. Moreover, as-installed control sequences can be formally verified against the design specification, and a semantic model in Brick can be exported to aid in configuration of building analytics and fault detection. The paper presents what we believe is the first translation of a Modelica-implemented control sequence to a native implementation on a commercial control platform, using the webCTRL product line from Automated Logic. The paper also shows how a webCTRL implementation can be formally verified against its Modelica specification. These use cases have all been demonstrated with a prototype implementation that is now being further developed.},

Efficiently utilized, this data could not only enhance the quality and effectiveness of buildings’ operational regimes, but also enrich the knowledge base for building design decision support. However, to exploit the potential of this data effectively, seamless data transformation processes are needed, starting from raw monitoring data and ending in adequately structured and visualized building performance data. In the present contribution, we provide a detailed blueprint of a well-defined and ontologically supported instance of such a transformation process. To illustrate this process, we focus in this paper on a specific class of building performance queries that require information on buildings’ visually relevant boundary conditions. Such queries pertain to, for example, the intensity of incident solar radiation of buildings’ envelope components, the daylight availability and 114distribution in interior spaces, and the expected output of building-integrated solar energy harvesting systems.},

To support emergency response, this study proposes an industry foundation class (IFC) based information exchange approach for multi-agency response to indoor fire emergencies. First, information required by occupants, facility managers and firefighters is identified and examined through a literature review and questionnaire surveys. The importance and familiarity of information are then assessed to clarify information sharing and collaboration in the practice. Next, this study extends properties of IFC4 Add2 by adding emergency information to support standardized information exchange. An add-in is created to enable automated parameter processing for information enrichment. The approach is validated through a case study, where relevant properties in an IFC data model are exchanged and supplied to emergency participants in real-time to facilitate response activities. The study's findings may shed light on role-centered emergency system prototyping, data-driven emergency simulations, and collaborative fire emergency response.}

However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry.}

To understand state-of-the-art NLP for smart construction, uncover related issues, and propose potential improvements, this paper presents a comprehensive review of bottom-level techniques and mainstream applications of NLP in the industry. In total, 124 journal articles published in the last two decades are reviewed. NLP involves five core steps supported by various techniques, e.g., syntactic parsing, heuristic rules, machine learning, and deep learning. NLP has been applied for information extraction and exchanging and many downstream applications to facilitate management and decision-making. The role of NLP in smart construction and current challenges for fully reaping its benefits are discussed, and four research directions are identified, i.e., improving relation extraction, realising knowledge base auto-development, integrating multi-modal information, and achieving an accuracy-efficiency trade-off by developing an NLP application framework. It is envisioned that outcomes of this paper can assist both researchers and industrial practitioners with appreciating the research and practice frontier of NLP for smart construction and soliciting the latest NLP techniques.}

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the complexity of professional mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) information, it is challenging to apply current common deep learning IE methods to the MEP domain. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a rule-based approach for MEP IE task, including a “snowball” strategy to collect large-scale MEP corpora, a suffix-based matching algorithm on text segments for named entity recognition (NER), and a dependency-path-based matching algorithm on dependency tree for relationship extraction (RE). 2 ideas called “meta linking” and “path filtering” for RE are proposed as well, to discover the out-of-pattern entities/relationships as many as possible. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, 65 MB MEP corpora have been collected as input of the proposed approach and an MEP semantic web which consists of 15,978 entities and 65,110 relationship triples established, with an accuracy of 81\% to entities and 75\% to relationship triples, respectively. A comparison experiment between classical deep learning models and the proposed rule-based approach was carried out, illustrating that the performance of our method is 37\% and 49\% better than the selected deep learning NER and RE models, respectively, in the aspect of extraction precision.}

Most design rationale is, however, never documented which can lead to information loss and re-working of already functional design solutions.

Currently, an increasing number of applications adopt BIM to improve the building operations and facility management. In these applications, matching real-world facilities to the corresponding BIM items is a fundamental yet challenging task. This study addresses this issue using Natural Language Processing. Firstly, a novel BIM hierarchy tree (HiTree) is proposed to model the original spatial structure relationships of a BIM. Then, the locations of facilities are extracted from natural language through processes of word segmentation, keyword extraction, and semantic disambiguation. Thirdly, an algorithm that matches real-world facilities to the BIM data is developed using the HiTree and the extracted locations. Finally, a concrete case for a 35,000 m 2 library is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution. BIM has become a common paradigm in the construction industry, and our scheme can facilitate more applications of BIM in building operations and facility management. One of the most representative applications is integrating the BIM data and information within IoT (Internet of Things) system intelligently by matching the BIM data to real-world facilities.}

With the growing visibility to city data, virtualized paradigms and integrated platforms of urban systems can inform urban scale analytics, and therefore help city policymakers to evaluate district and city-scale energy efficiency issues and opportunities. This demo will showcase an open and free data and computing web platform CityBES, which uses CityGML-based 3D city models, simulates building performance to identify retrofit measures that can cut building stock energy use by 50\%, and evaluates city-wide PV potential. CityBES visualizes 3D-GIS integrated building performance in dozens of metrics (e.g., energy, water, demand, cost, GHG, savings, and regulation compliance status) for each building at urban scale. There are three layers in the software architecture of CityBES: the Data layer, the Algorithms and Software layer, and the Use Cases layer. The Data layer includes the weather data, and the CityGML 3D city models. The Software layer capsules the simulation cores Commercial Building Energy Saver (CBES) which is built upon EnergyPlus and OpenStudio. The Use Cases layer provides examples of potential applications. The demo intends to introduce some of the applications and workflows of CityBES at the data level, regarding data integration, visualization and utilization. Functionalities include integrating building data from different resources to compile and visualize building performance related database, and to construct city-scale building energy models. Utilizing the models to link and interact with district utility data and sensor network data, the platform is able to simulate and predict the spatiotemporal energy fluctuations of cities.},

However, a point of contention in this integration has yet to be resolved. In view of the shortcomings of the network transmission and browser rendering of current integrated BIM-GIS schemes, accordingly the 3D Tiles data format using Web Graphics Library (WebGL) as the standard for rendering 3D models has been widely considered in recent years. This study provides an implementation plan for data integration and information interaction between BIM and GIS. It aims to improve the traditional model simplification processing solution, analyze the current insufficient network transmission and browser rendering ability of the BIM and GIS integration scheme, and transform the BIM model from the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) into the 3D Tiles data format. In this study, IFC standard files are first exported as the data source, and the mapping relationship between BIM files and 3D Tiles files is analyzed. The integral IFC model is then reorganized to form JSON files associated with semantic attributes and building component models with geometric information. The proposed relationship mapping allows the attribute contained in the IFC models to be delivered to 3D tiles. Meanwhile, the coordinate transformation, data mapping, spatial index, and Level of Details (LOD) hierarchical division are completed during conversion to ensure fast and efficient rendering interaction of BIM data and geographical features in the 3D WebGIS framework. The experiment results indicated that users can quickly load the BIM model on the Web site, which may be viewed as a feasible solution for the large-scale data integration of GIS and BIM on the Web site.}

To support ACC, building code requirements need to be represented in a computer-processable format to enable automated reasoning, which will in turn allow an automated assessment of the building design's compliance status with building codes. A major limitation of many existing ACC systems/methods is their limited range of checkable building code requirements. To address that, the state of the art uses pattern matching-based rules to transform building code requirements into computable formats automatically, but the ruleset was developed and tested only on a few chapters of building code requirements. An efficient ruleset expansion method is needed to increase its range of checkable building code requirements at a low cost, to bring ACC systems closer to full deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a new regulatory information transformation ruleset expansion method for expanding an existing ruleset. This method can expand the range of checkable code requirements of ACC systems without significant manual effort. The proposed ruleset expansion method takes an iterative approach to ensure the generality and validity of new pattern matching-based rules and the quality of information transformation results. The expanded ruleset was tested on generating logic clauses from Chapter 5 of the International Building Code 2015. Compared to the baseline ruleset, the expanded ruleset increased the predicate-level precision, recall, and F1-score of the logic clause generation by 10.44\%, 25.72\%, and 18.02\%, to 95.17\%, 96.60\%, and 95.88\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {To fully automate building code compliance checking, regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted and transformed from building codes. Existing regulatory requirement processing efforts mainly focus on building code requirements in text. A more efficient approach for processing regulatory requirements in other parts of building codes, such as tables or charts, remains to be addressed. The ability to process building code requirements in all parts and formats is necessary for an automated code compliance checking system to achieve full coverage of checkable building code requirements. To address this gap, the authors propose a semiautomated information extraction and transformation method. The proposed method can extract building code requirements in tables and convert extracted information to logic rules. Automated code compliance checking systems can utilize the logic rules. The proposed method includes two main steps: (1)~tabular information extraction, and (2)~rule generation. The tabular information extraction semiautomatically detects the layout of tables, extracts building code requirements from tables, and transforms extracted information to databases. The rule generation step automatically generates logic rules that can be directly executed by logic reasoners. The rule generation step also provides options for users to further refine the generated rules. The development of the tabular information extraction algorithm takes an iterative approach. An experiment was conducted to develop a tabular information extraction algorithm from a section of existing code. The primary version of the algorithm correctly processed 91.67\% of tables in a second sample section. After iterative refinements, the updated tabular information extraction algorithm correctly processed all tables in this section. The rule generation algorithm correctly generated logic rules that successfully represented the applicable building code requirements for a testing building, a convenience store in Texas based on the tabular information.},

  abstract = {The nation’s massive underground utility infrastructure must comply with a multitude of regulations. The regulatory compliance checking of underground utilities requires an objective and consistent interpretation of the regulations. However, utility regulations contain a variety of domain-specific terms and numerous spatial constraints regarding the location and clearance of underground utilities. It is challenging for the interpreters to understand both the domain and spatial semantics in utility regulations. To address the challenge, this paper adopts an ontology and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automate the interpretation of utility regulations – the extraction of regulatory information and the subsequent transformation into logic clauses. Two new ontologies have been developed. The urban product ontology (UPO) is domain-specific to model domain concepts and capture domain semantics on top of heterogeneous terminologies in utility regulations. The spatial ontology (SO) consists of two layers of semantics – linguistic spatial expressions and formal spatial relations – for better understanding the spatial language in utility regulations. Pattern-matching rules defined on syntactic features (captured using common NLP techniques) and semantic features (captured using ontologies) were encoded for information extraction. The extracted information elements were then mapped to their semantic correspondences via ontologies and finally transformed into deontic logic (DL) clauses to achieve the semantic and logical formalization. The approach was tested on the spatial configuration-related requirements in utility accommodation policies. Results show it achieves a 98.2\% precision and a 94.7\% recall in information extraction, a 94.4\% precision and a 90.1\% recall in semantic formalization, and an 83\% accuracy in logical formalization.},

  abstract = {Utility regulations stipulate the spatial configurations between underground utilities and their surroundings to avoid interferences and disruptions of utility services. Utility compliance checking aims to detect spatial non-compliances in underground utilities by examining geospatial data of utilities and their surroundings against textual data of utility regulations. However, the integration of heterogeneous utility geospatial and textual data for compliance checking remains a big challenge. This paper presents a semantic approach to integrate heterogeneous data and enable automated compliance checking of underground utilities through logic and spatial reasoning. The approach consists of the following key components: (1) four interlinked ontologies that provide the semantic schema for heterogeneous data relevant to utility compliance checking, (2) two data convertors for the conversion of heterogeneous data from proprietary formats into a common and interoperable format following the semantic schema, and (3) a query mechanism with spatial extensions for the detection of non-compliant utility instances. The approach was tested on a sample utility database, and the results demonstrate the success of the proposed approach in the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple sources and automated detection of spatial non-compliances in underground utilities. In addition to utility compliance checking, the approach can be extended to other application cases where both data integration from multiple sources and spatial reasoning are required.},

While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (e.g., question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The practical and ethical challenges of LLMs-based innovations were also identified by assessing their technological readiness, model performance, replicability, system transparency, privacy, equality, and beneficence. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-3), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. These recommendations could support future research to develop practical and ethical innovations for supporting diverse educational tasks and benefiting students, teachers, and institutions.},

However, despite the abundance of research on the difference in capabilities between GPT series models and fine-tuned models, there has been limited attention given to the evolution of GPT series models' capabilities over time. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of GPT series models, we select six representative models, comprising two GPT-3 series models (i.e., davinci and text-davinci-001) and four GPT-3.5 series models (i.e., code-davinci-002, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003, and gpt-3.5-turbo). We evaluate their performance on nine natural language understanding (NLU) tasks using 21 datasets. In particular, we compare the performance and robustness of different models for each task under zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal that the overall ability of GPT series models on NLU tasks does not increase gradually as the models evolve, especially with the introduction of the RLHF training strategy. While this strategy enhances the models' ability to generate human-like responses, it also compromises their ability to solve some tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that there is still room for improvement in areas such as model robustness.},

  abstract = {Retrofits of existing buildings have great potential to reduce global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy modeling of existing buildings, which is commonly conducted to prioritize retrofit strategies, relies on as-is building energy models (BEMs) that represent actual conditions of buildings. Recent efforts have focused on leveraging sensing technologies such as laser scanning and photogrammetry to capture as-is conditions of buildings and developing automatic methods for creating BEMs using the captured data. However, the majority of these efforts are limited to reconstructing 3D facade geometries with poor semantic information for rough BEM use. To this end, this paper presents a framework for an image-based approach to construct complete and semantic as-is BEM geometry models for existing buildings. The framework consists of four modules: 1) the data capture module that collects digital images of building facades and interior spaces and relevant placement information for geometry definition; 2) the building surface geometry reconstruction module that recognizes main building components required by BEM and reconstructs their 3D surface geometries from captured images; 3) the semantic enrichment module that adds the required geometry-related semantic relationships among the reconstructed building elements and interior spaces; and 4) the BEM creation module that stores the semantic geometry model in IDF data model. This framework is expected to extend existing research by creating complete (i.e. include not only building facades but also interior spaces) and semantic-rich as-is BEM geometry models.}

These implementations are point solutions, which require systematic integration to combine their information to enable a holistic picture of CW. The major barrier to such integration is information heterogeneity, where the information is collected from different systems under multiple contexts. Scholars in the construction domain have explored the use of ontology to solve the information-integration problem, although an ontology that both adequately represents the CW and integrates the digitalized information of CW via various systems and multiple contexts is currently missing from the existing literature. This research thus presents an ontology set for formalizing and integrating CW information within the digital construction context. The proposed digital construction ontologies (DiCon) are shared representations of construction domain knowledge that specify the terms and relations of CWs and their related information. We developed the DiCon based on a hybrid ontology development approach. The DiCon includes six modules: Entities, Processes, Information, Agents, Variables, and Contexts. The developed DiCon was further evaluated by approaches including automatic consistency checking, criteria-based evaluation, expert workshops, and task-based evaluation and involved two use cases by answering relevant competency questions via SPARQL queries. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that the DiCon ontologies are sufficient to represent domain knowledge and can formalize and integrate CW information within the digital construction context.},

  abstract = {Industry 4.0 embraces digitization and smart products or processes that are integrated with several technological developments to control the entire value chain of workflows. The construction industry is also captivated with the idea of Industry 4.0 transformation that changes the traditional system into digital and cyber-physical system that interacts and connects across the geographical and organizational borders. However, as construction is commonly known as a low-technologically advanced industry, studies on Industry 4.0 in construction still remains elusive, as compared to other sectors such as manufacturing, electrical and electronic engineering and computer science. Therefore, this study aims to explore the current state of Industry 4.0 application from the construction engineering perspective. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify publications related to Industry 4.0 in construction. A bibliometric analysis has been outlined through exclusion and inclusion principles, while a scientometric analysis has been further applied to enhance the SLR findings through ‘science mapping’ visualization techniques. This study presents the relevance, along with the movement, adoption and adaption of Industry 4.0 in the construction industry that further enables the spark of new ideas, in effort to realize and comprehend the current and future technological transformation in construction.},

  abstract = {Modern cities require innovative urban design and development approaches that are efficiently tailored for neighborhood needs. To achieve this, decision makers must deal with information from both the micro (building asset) and the macro (neighborhood) levels, consequently deal with two very different information scopes and standards. This paper addresses this issue and introduces a new conceptual approach for developing a hybrid information infrastructure by integrating building design data, in the form of ifcXML, and 3D neighborhood models, in the form of CityGML. This paper uses examples from the operations and maintenance domain to explain the need for data integration to support decision makers at the neighborhood level by providing access to a wide range of detailed data, starting from the neighborhood scale and zooming in to a room in a building. The BIMCityGML Data Integration (BCDI) approach that is introduced in this research satisfies both geometric and nongeometric (semantic) information queries in real time. This feature distinguishes BCDI significantly from related works that mainly focus on data conversion from one source to another. Furthermore, this work provides deep insights into the data structure of ifcXML and CityGML and discusses data mapping issues between these two common data standards.}

The core question in this research is “how to manage these transaction specifications? Existing standards focus on the development and not on the management of these transaction specifications in the domain of infrastructure management, which emphasizes the motivation to develop a web- based tool—Infrastructure Transaction Management Portal. An ontology-based approach was devised to develop the portal using the SharePoint platform. The portal was developed based on the knowledge represented in the Transaction Domain Ontology built as part of this research work. The transaction specification developed for the asset inventory and condition assessment reporting was used to demonstrate how a transaction specification can be managed using the proposed portal.},

Currently, this regulatory information is mostly available in the unstructured and non-machine-readable form of guidelines, regulations, and standards. The acquisition and conversion of unstructured data into structured semantic knowledge bases for the use in the BIM processes are increasingly being automated using natural language processing in ongoing research. Since ontologies provide such techniques that allow raw data to be formally transformed into domain knowledge, in this paper an ontology is developed based on the data format for data catalogs, properties, and groups of properties described in the ISO 23386. The contribution of this paper is a systematic requirements analysis based on existing literature, standardization, and existing ontologies and the implementation of an ontology accordingly. Applied to a feature of interest, an exemplary property validation using the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) and generated Shapes and Constraint Language (SHACL) shapes is performed to show how the collected data can be used for automatic constraint checking.},

  abstract = {With the advance of the internet of things and building management system (BMS) in modern buildings, there is an opportunity of using the data to extend the use of building energy modeling (BEM) beyond the design phase. Potential applications include retrofit analysis, measurement and verification, and operations and controls. However, while BMS is collecting a vast amount of operation data, different suppliers and sensor installers typically apply their own customized or even random non-uniform rules to define the metadata, i.e., the point tags. This results in a need to interpret and manually map any BMS data before using it for energy analysis. The mapping process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires comprehensive prior knowledge. Additionally, BMS metadata typically has considerable variety and limited context information, limiting the applicability of existing interpreting methods. In this paper, we proposed a text mining framework to facilitate interpreting and mapping BMS points to EnergyPlus variables. The framework is based on unsupervised density-based clustering (DBSCAN) and a novel fuzzy string matching algorithm “X-gram”. Therefore, it is generalizable among different buildings and naming conventions. We compare the proposed framework against commonly used baselines that include morphological analysis and widely used text mining techniques. Using two building cases from Singapore and two from the United States, we demonstrated that the framework outperformed baseline methods by 25.5\%, with the measurement extraction F-measure of 87.2\% and an average mapping accuracy of 91.4\%.},

Automated compliance checking saves time and resources, which is beneficial for the construction industry. Researchers have already automated parts of the building permit process and the results proved that automated building requirement compliance checking is efficient. This thesis aims to contribute by developing an algorithm to automate the checking of building placement and parking availability. The algorithm should be able to: 1) check if the house is in a buildable area, 2) examine if the house placement meets the minimum distance requirement, 3) determine parking availability with accordance to house placement.  The algorithm in this study is developed in Feature Manipulation Engine (FME). Building placement automation is achieved through minimum distance logic while parking availability automation is achieved through transformations that utilize geometrical relationships. To test the algorithm, a case study is conducted for Höganäs municipality in Southern Sweden.  In Sweden, each municipality has its own detailed development plan, which regulates the usage of land and water within its geographical boundaries. The detailed development plan also regulates building requirements. The results of the testing indicate that the developed algorithm can accurately automate building placement and parking availability according to the requirements in Höganäs municipality’s detailed development plan. The results are satisfactory, demonstrating that it is feasible to automate the checking of certain building requirements in Sweden.},

  abstract = {One of the major goals of building information modeling is to support automated compliance checking (ACC). To support ACC, building design information needs to be extracted from building information models (BIMs) and transformed into a representation that would allow for automated reasoning about those design information in combination with information from regulatory documents. However, existing BIM information extraction (IE) efforts are limited in supporting complete automation of ACC. Complete automation of ACC requires (1) automating both the extraction of information from BIMs and the extraction of regulatory information from regulatory documents and (2) aligning the instances of information concepts and relations extracted from a BIM with those extracted from regulatory documents, in order to facilitate direct automated reasoning about both information for compliance assessment. To address this gap, this paper proposes an automated BIM IE method for extracting design information from industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs into a semantic logic-based representation that is aligned with a matching semantic logic-based representation of regulatory information. The proposed BIM IE method utilizes semantic natural language processing (NLP) techniques and java standard data access interface (JSDAI) techniques to automatically extract project information from IFC-based BIMs and transform it into a logic format (logic facts) that is ready to be automatically checked against logic-represented regulatory rules (logic rules). The BIM IE method was tested on extracting design information from a Duplex Apartment BIM model. Compared to a manually developed gold standard, the testing results showed 100\% precision and a short time of 15.02 seconds for processing 38,898 lines of data.},

Computer vision currently can identify the entities and attributes inside the construction scenes but fail to generate interaction-level scene descriptions and integrate them with domain knowledge for hazards inference. This paper proposed an automatic hazard inference method using construction scene graphs and C-BERT network. First, computer vision was utilized to build the construction scene graphs with interaction-level scene descriptions including entities, attributes, and their interactions. Second, C-BERT network was designed to infer hazards by integrating scene graphs with domain knowledge like construction regulations. 5 different working scenes were used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach and reached 97.82\% of hazard identification accuracy. It provided an efficient method for combining visual information and domain knowledge for automated safety monitoring, and path for the industry's massive multimodal information fusion.}

There should be different calculation methods for different design steps during the whole process and the output of the tools needs to be simplified to meet the needs of users since the users of these tools may come from different majors and have little professional knowledge in CE.

With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible for us to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle. In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? Toward answering this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its techniques to applications. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from model architecture and self-supervised pretraining to generative modeling methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including text, images, videos, 3D content, etc., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream industries, such as education and creativity content. Finally, we discuss the challenges currently faced and present an outlook on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.},

  abstract = {Automated compliance checking (ACC) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (BIMs). However, current industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs provide limited support for ACC, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (CC). In this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the IFC schema to incorporate CC-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. The method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to CC (e.g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the IFC class hierarchy. The proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from CC-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related IFC concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related IFC concepts. The proposed method enables the extension of the IFC schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. To test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the International Building Code (IBC) 2006 and 2009. Chapter 12 of IBC 2006 was used for training/development and Chapter 19 of IBC 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. Comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7\% F1-measure, 84.5\% adoption rate, and 87.9\% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, IFC concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively},

Building information modeling (BIM) is an effective technology to digitize building information, whereas artificial intelligence (AI) techniques facilitate automation. It could be contributive to focus on how to integrate BIM with AI techniques and apply them in actual projects. However, a comprehensive review of integrated applications is still lacking. This study reviews BIM-AI integrations in the AEC/FM industry by systematic-bibliometric analysis, and 183 eligible literature items are adopted. Bibliometric analysis reveals time series, journals, keywords co-occurrence, and co-authorship of eligible literature. Findings are summarized from perspectives of techniques and applications. Three typical integrated modes are determined based on the findings. Ultimately, current challenges and future directions of the development of BIM-AI integrations are proposed.

Two BIM operational standards required by local building regulations and laws, the Dutch Rgd BIM Norm, and the Norwegian Statsbygg BIM Manual are used to validate both the mvdXML standardsÕ capabilities and the tools implementation. The rules from these standards are categorized into different rule types and converted to mvdXML templates and rules. These rules are then tested using a prototypical, open source software tool. By combining this tool with a BCF server we demonstrate the deployment of such automated checking procedures in real working processes. Based on these experiences, a detailed discussion about identified issues is provided as the starting point for the future research and a feedback to standardization organizations.},

  abstract = {Background Many research and development efforts have been made for automated compliance checking of building designs with regulatory requirements, but there is a lack of a non-proprietary and user-understandable representation of building regulations to support automated compliance checking in the construction domain that is experimentally tested for understandability and reading speed. Methods This research investigates a logic-based representation and tree-based visualization method for building regulatory requirements. The logic-based representation is based on classic logic programming language and can directly support automated compliance checking. The tree-based visualization is expected to improve the understandability and reading speed of the logic-based representation. Therefore, this method attempts to add to the limited research in non-proprietary and user-understandable representation of building regulations that is experimentally tested for understandability and reading speed. To test the understandability and reading speed of regulatory requirements using this representation and visualization method, a survey was conducted to compare different representations, namely, text, logic-based, and tree-based. ResultsStatistical analysis of the survey results shows that the proposed tree-based visualization method can significantly improve the understandability and reading speed of the logic-based regulatory requirement representation and this visualization method is at a comparable status with the original text representation of regulatory requirements in terms of understandability and reading speed. Conclusions(1) The investigated logic-based representation and tree-based visualization method for regulatory requirements serves as one potential non-proprietary and user-understandable representation of building regulations; (2) this research shows that computable representations of regulatory requirements can achieve understandability and reading speed that are comparable to the original text representation through tree-based visualization; and (3) this research reveals that the tree-based visualization of regulatory requirements improves the understandability and reading speed of regulatory requirements when such use is compared to the computable logic-based representation.},

  abstract = {Existing automated building code checking systems/software highly rely on human interpretation of the code. Different methods have been proposed and implemented to make building codes automatically analyzable and interpretable by computers. These methods have achieved different levels of automation in rule formalization, but they all require some level of human involvement to capture the compliance checking-related semantic information in the natural language building code sentences. For example, the state-of-the art approaches require human annotation or require human effort to develop annotation and/or extraction rules. To reduce the human effort in automated code interpretation, this paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to automatically label the semantic roles in building code sentences for supporting code compliance checking. The proposed method consists of three primary elements: (1) capturing the syntactic and semantic features of the building code sentences using natural language processing techniques; (2) adapting out-of-domain training data to the task at hand based on data similarity; and (3) performing semantic role labeling using a conditional random field (CRF) model. The proposed approach was tested on a corpus of annotated text from the International Building Code, and achieved promising global precision.},

  abstract = {A new ACC system that leverages semantic natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically extract information from regulatory documents and represent them in a logic based rule format is presented. A number of important efforts have been made, both in academia and industry, to automate the code compliance checking process. While important progress has been achieved, existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems are not entirely automated; manual effort is needed for extracting regulatory requirements from codes and encoding them in a computer processable rule format. To address this gap, this paper presents a new ACC system that leverages semantic natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically extract information from regulatory documents and represent them in a logic based rule format. The proposed systems is composed of three modules: (1) semantic NLP based regulatory information extraction and transformation algorithms to automatically extract regulatory information from regulatory documents into semantic tuples and automatically transform the extracted regulatory information in semantic tuples into logic rules; (2) semantic rule based design information extraction and transformation algorithms to automatically extract design information from building information models and transform the design information into logic facts; and (3) a logic-based reasoning algorithm to automatically reason about the logic rules and facts and generate compliance checking reports. To test the performance of the proposed system, as a whole, and how the different algorithms are performing together as one unit for detecting noncompliance instances, the proposed algorithms were implemented and integrated into a proof-of-concept prototype. The prototype was tested in checking the compliance of a design test case with Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009, and the performance was evaluated in terms of precision and recall.},

Such information extraction (IE) is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based NLP approach for automated IE from construction regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict resolution (CR) rules in IE. A variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the IE and CR rules. Phrase structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed IE algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively.},

Semantic web based rule checking of BIM models are widely accepted and studied recent years. This technology has noteworthy advantages on interoperability, extensibility and logical basics. However, there are still some gaps to make it practical. One challenge is the efficiency problem on processing large-scale BIM models. The other is how to effectively input checking rules which can be understood by both human beings and machines. In this paper, we propose a pragmatic method to check real-world scale BIM models. In our framework, BIM models are transformed into a well-defined OWL model. Rules are formalized by a structured natural language (SNL) designed intentionally to describe building regulations. The checking engine is based on SPARQL queries on OWL models. We propose a rule-based model extraction method and optimization strategies on SPARQL statements, which can effectively improve the time efficiency and deal with large-scale applications. A prototype has been implemented and applied to BIM models of a real-world building project. We found out non-trivial problems in a totally automatic way, which helped to improve the quality of BIM models and verified the usability of our method.},

Existing information alignment methods typically require intensive manual effort and their ability to deal with the complex regulatory concepts in the regulations is limited. To address this gap, this paper proposes a deep learning method for IFC-regulation semantic information alignment. The proposed method uses a relation classification model to relate and align the IFC and regulatory concepts. The method uses a transformer-based model and leverages the definitions of the concepts and an IFC knowledge graph to provide additional contextual information and knowledge for improved classification and alignment. The proposed method was evaluated on IFC concepts from IFC 4 and regulatory concepts from different building codes and standards. The experimental results showed good information alignment performance.},

The POE offers an opportunity to investigate the buildings' actual performance based upon the occupants' satisfaction levels in the aspects of building overall design, indoor environmental quality, thermal comfort, etc. However, as the key part of POE, occupant satisfaction assessment (OSA) is a missing link in the building performance evaluation (BPE) domain, and there is not a systematic evaluation method for the OSA. Moreover, it is time-consuming and error-prone to conduct the OSA manually. This paper presents from the end-user's satisfaction perspective a semantic post-occupancy evaluation ontology (POEontology) to facilitate the occupant satisfaction assessment of buildings, with the ultimate aim of optimizing building operation guidelines, and improving occupants' use experience quality and well-being. An ontology-based knowledge model has been developed to capture the fragmented knowledge of building use satisfaction assessment in the POE domain, with the benchmarking evaluation rules encoded in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to enable automatic rule-based rating and reasoning. This ontology model also enables the effective OSA-related knowledge retrieving and sharing, and promotes its implementation in the POE domain. A field study has been conducted based upon the Building Use Study (BUS) methodology to validate the proposed ontology framework.},

  abstract = {As an essential task for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, information processing and acquiring from unstructured textual data based on natural language processing (NLP) are gaining increasing attention. Although deep learning (DL) models for NLP tasks have been investigated for years, domain-specific pretrained DL models and their advantages are seldomly investigated in the AEC domain. Therefore, this work developed a large scale domain corpora and pretrained domain-specific language models for the AEC domain, and then systematically explores various transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques to explore the performance of pretrained DL models for various NLP tasks. First, both in-domain and close-domain Chinese corpora are developed. Then, two types of pretrained models, including static word embedding models and contextual word embedding models, are pretrained based on various domain corpora. Finally, several widely used DL models for NLP tasks are further trained and tested based on various pretrained models. The result shows that domain corpora can further improve the performance of static word embedding-based DL models and contextual word embedding-based DL models in text classification (TC) and named entity recognition (NER) tasks. Meanwhile, contextual word embedding-based DL models significantly outperform the static word embedding-based DL methods in TC and NER tasks, with maximum improvements of 8.1\% and 3.8\% in the F1 score, respectively. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in two ways: (1) demonstrating the advantages of domain corpora and pretrained DL models, and (2) opening the first domain-specific dataset and pretrained language models named ARCBERT for the AEC domain. Thus, this work sheds light on the adoption and application of pretrained models in the AEC domain.},

  abstract = {Construction procedural constraints are critical in facilitating effective construction procedure checking in practice and for various inspection systems. Nowadays, the manual extraction of construction procedural constraints is costly and time-consuming. The automatic extraction of construction procedural constraint knowledge (e.g., knowledge entities and interlinks/relationships between them) from regulatory documents is a key challenge. Traditionally, natural language processing is implemented using either rule-based or machine learning approaches. Limited efforts on rule-based extraction of construction regulations often rely on pre-defined vocabularies and involve heavy feature engineering. Based on characteristics of the knowledge expression of construction procedural constraints in Chinese regulations, this paper explores a hybrid deep neural network, combining the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and the conditional random field (CRF), for the automatic extraction of the qualitative construction procedural constraints. Based on the proposed deep neural network, the recognition and extraction of named entities and relations between them are realized. Unlike existing information extraction research efforts using rule-based methods, the proposed hybrid deep learning approach can be applied without complex handcrafted features engineering. Besides, the long distance dependency relationships between different entities in regulations are considered. The model implementation results demonstrate the good performance of the end-to-end deep neural network in the extraction of construction procedural constraints. This study can be considered as one of the early explorations of knowledge extraction from construction regulations.},

The task of developing technical plans is critical to ensuring the success of a construction project. This task of preparing a technical plan is usually undertaken manually using two separate processes: (1) plan definition and (2) verification/checking. This paper introduces an ontological approach to support the plan definition and verification process. Using this approach, the technical plans are modeled into plan ontology in a layered modeling structure. The verification knowledge is modeled into ontology axioms and semantic rules. A case example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach for pit excavation. In addition, the proposed approach enables the compliance verification process to be undertaken in parallel with the technical plan definition. As a result, the plans' compliance can be ensured during the project delivery process. The research provides a novel ontological and semantic mechanism for reusing plans and their automatic verification in construction, which is semantically reasoned.},

The information required for monitoring and checking is obtained from different data sources in different information systems. In this context, information sharing between stakeholders and the semantic interoperability that prevails with varying information systems are necessary. However, the implementation of information sharing and semantic interoperability can be a challenge. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling (BIM) environment among different information systems. The framework integrates building information from BIM, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The regulation clauses are transformed into SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) rules. A case study is performed to apply the framework, and environmental monitoring and automated compliance checking are implemented in the context of a real distributed energy station project. The testing results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Regulations play an important role in assuring the construction quality. However, due to the large amount of regulation needs considered, the construction quality compliance checking against regulations can be cumbersome/time-consuming and error prone. In order to give more computerized support to the construction quality compliance checking against regulations, an ontology-based semantic modeling approach of regulation constraints is explored. A meta model for construction quality inspection and evaluation i.e. CQIEOntology is proposed in this paper. Based on CQIEontology, the regulation constraints are modeled into OWL axioms and SWRL rules. By these OWL axioms and SWRL rules, the regulation provisions imposed on construction quality inspection can be translated into a set of inspection tasks, and get associated with the specific construction tasks. Once the construction starts, the applicable inspection tasks, including a series of quality checking and evaluation, will be reminded and recommended. Obviously, the proposed approach facilitates taking the construction quality compliance checking as a paralleling activity to the construction rather than an afterthought, and helps the inspectors in quality inspection. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in Protégé 3.4.6 through case studies based on regulation examples taken from “Code for Acceptance of Construction Quality of Building Foundation (GB50202-2002) and the validation and discussion are given for it.”},

Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53\%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were “project management” at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from “project management”, and “knowledge management” to “building information modeling”, and “compliance control” with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry. Four research themes were identified with the combination of cluster analysis and critical review: “Domain ontology”, “Industry foundation classes”, “Automated compliance checking”, and “Building information modeling”.

Specifically, a DSMS domain ontology (OntoDSMS) is developed by comprehensively collecting domain knowledge and extracting context information from the dam information model. Furthermore, a rule-based reasoner and SPARQL queries are implemented. The proposed approach facilitates the effective integration of dam safety monitoring information while reducing retrieval time effectively compared with traditional databases. A case is illustrated to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed approach.}

A pretrained foundation model, such as BERT, GPT-3, MAE, DALLE-E, and ChatGPT, is trained on large-scale data which provides a reasonable parameter initialization for a wide range of downstream applications. The idea of pretraining behind PFMs plays an important role in the application of large models. Different from previous methods that apply convolution and recurrent modules for feature extractions, the generative pre-training (GPT) method applies Transformer as the feature extractor and is trained on large datasets with an autoregressive paradigm. Similarly, the BERT apples transformers to train on large datasets as a contextual language model. Recently, the ChatGPT shows promising success on large language models, which applies an autoregressive language model with zero shot or few show prompting. With the extraordinary success of PFMs, AI has made waves in a variety of fields over the past few years. Considerable methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, the need is raising for an updated survey. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent research advancements, current and future challenges, and opportunities for PFMs in text, image, graph, as well as other data modalities. We first review the basic components and existing pretraining in natural language processing, computer vision, and graph learning. We then discuss other advanced PFMs for other data modalities and unified PFMs considering the data quality and quantity. Besides, we discuss relevant research about the fundamentals of the PFM, including model efficiency and compression, security, and privacy.

Although many research efforts have indicated the potential of BIM and ontology for automated compliance checking, an efficient methodology is still required for the interoperability and semantic representation of data from different sources. Therefore, a natural language processing (NLP)-based semantic framework is proposed in this paper, which implements rules-based automated compliance checking for building information modeling (BIM) at the design stage. Semantic-rich information can be extracted from safety regulations by NLP methods, which were analyzed to generate conceptual classes and individuals of ontology and provide a corpus basis for rule classification. The data on BIM was extracted from Revit to a spreadsheet using the Dynamo tool and then mapped to the ontology using the Cellfie tool. The interoperability of different source data was well improved through the isomorphism of information in the framework of semantic integration, causing data processed by the semantic web rule language to be transformed from safety regulations to achieve the purpose that automated compliance checking is implemented in the design documents. The practicability and scientific feasibility of the proposed framework was verified through a 95.21\% recall and a 90.63\% precision in compliance checking of a case study in China. Compared with traditional compliance checking methods, the proposed framework had high efficiency, response speed, data interoperability, and interaction.},

  abstract = {Automated rule checking (ARC) is expected to significantly promote the efficiency and compliance of design in the construction industry. The most vital and complex stage of ARC is interpreting the regulatory text into a computer-processable format. However, existing systems and studies of rule interpretation either require considerable time-consuming manual effort or are based on exhaustive enumerations of matching patterns with a limited scope of application. To address this problem, this research integrates natural language processing (NLP) and context-free grammar (CFG) to propose a novel generalized rule interpretation framework, which can parse regulatory text like a domain-specific language. First, a syntax tree structure with several semantic elements is proposed to represent the roles and relations of concepts in regulatory text. Second, a deep learning model with the transfer learning technique is utilized to label the semantic elements in a sentence. Finally, a set of CFGs is built to parse a labeled sentence into the language-independent tree structure, from which computable checking rules can be generated. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods: it achieves 99.6\% and 91.0\% accuracies for parsing single- and multi-requirement sentences, respectively, where the multi-requirement sentences are more complex and common but difficult for existing methods to deal with. This research contributes a method and framework for rule interpretation with both a high level of automation and wide scope of application, which can create computable rules from various textual regulatory documents. This research also publishes the first regulation dataset for future exploration, validation, and benchmarking in the ARC area.},

Query answering is, however, computationally very expensive, which has led to the development of query answering procedures that sacrifice either expressive power of the ontology language, or the completeness of query answers in order to improve scalability. In this paper, we describe a hybrid approach to query answering over OWL 2 ontologies that combines a datalog reasoner with a fully-fledged OWL 2 reasoner in order to provide scalable `pay-as-you-go' performance. The key feature of our approach is that it delegates the bulk of the computation to the datalog reasoner and resorts to expensive OWL 2 reasoning only as necessary to fully answer the query. Furthermore, although our main goal  is to efficiently answer queries over OWL 2 ontologies and data, our technical results are very general and our approach is applicable to first-order knowledge representation languages that can be captured by rules allowing for existential quantification and disjunction in the head; our only assumption is the availability of a datalog reasoner and a fully-fledged reasoner for the language of interest,  both of which are used as `black boxes'. We have implemented our techniques in the PAGOdA system, which combines the datalog reasoner RDFox and the  OWL 2 reasoner HermiT. Our extensive evaluation shows that PAGOdA succeeds in providing scalable pay-as-you-go query answering for a wide range of OWL 2 ontologies, datasets and queries.},

  abstract = {This study attempts to address a challenge regarding the extraction of building information, which is one of the fundamental tasks that needs to be addressed in the construction domain. Current technologies, such as relational databases, have difficulty in efficiently and effectively managing and querying the interconnected building information with full of hidden relationships. To address this problem, this study adopted the graph-theory-based graph database technology to reveal hidden relationships within building information. A model-driven approach was developed to enable a full conversion of Industry Foundation Classes data into labeled property graph, which is referred to as IFC-Graph. The result shows that IFC-Graph can represent interconnected building information and reveal hidden relationships, supporting effective and efficient building information access and query. This study can benefit a vast number of future studies in the area of building information query by improving its accessibility and queryability.}
