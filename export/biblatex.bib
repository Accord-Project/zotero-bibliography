	abstract = {Rule checking is important to assure the integrity, correctness and usability of Building Information Models ({BIMs}) in Architecture, Engineering and Construction ({AEC}) projects. Semantic web based rule checking of {BIM} models are widely accepted and studied recent years. This technology has noteworthy advantages on interoperability, extensibility and logical basics. However, there are still some gaps to make it practical. One challenge is the efficiency problem on processing large-scale {BIM} models. The other is how to effectively input checking rules which can be understood by both human beings and machines. In this paper, we propose a pragmatic method to check real-world scale {BIM} models. In our framework, {BIM} models are transformed into a well-defined {OWL} model. Rules are formalized by a structured natural language ({SNL}) designed intentionally to describe building regulations. The checking engine is based on {SPARQL} queries on {OWL} models. We propose a rule-based model extraction method and optimization strategies on {SPARQL} statements, which can effectively improve the time efficiency and deal with large-scale applications. A prototype has been implemented and applied to {BIM} models of a real-world building project. We found out non-trivial problems in a totally automatic way, which helped to improve the quality of {BIM} models and verified the usability of our method.},

Here we demonstrate the ability of deep learning artificial neural networks to semantically segment images of building facilities. We found this deep learning approach capable of simultaneously recognizing: ceiling, wall, plumbing, duct, door, floor, and stairs classes. This semantic scope surpasses state-of-the-art building system recognition methods and represents progress towards comprehensive {BIM} creation.},

In recent years, simulation platforms have been employed to study {ITS} applications, mostly focusing on traffic-related simulations. Despite several research studies on {ITS} applications and simulation platforms, formal semantic descriptions of intelligent transportation systems have not been addressed yet. In this paper, a semantic model describing intelligent transportation systems for roads is proposed. The semantic model is devised to provide a basis for designing {ITS} simulation platforms. Building upon the semantic model, an extension to an open building information modeling ({BIM}) standard, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) schema, is presented. The {IFC} schema extension is verified and validated using a {BIM}-based simulation scenario of {ITS} for roads. It is shown that the proposed {IFC}-compliant description of {ITS} for roads provides a formal basis for generating {BIM}-based simulations and hence facilitates {ITS} infrastructure modeling in {BIM} projects. It is concluded that the present work represents a cornerstone for designing {BIM}-based {ITS} simulation platforms.

Indeed these are great efforts, but, still there is a gap for the fully automatic building code-compliance. This paper presents our research and development of Semantic {BIM} Reasoner ({SBIM}-Reasoner) which employs semantic technologies to meet the requirements of semantic verification of an {IFC} model. {SBIM}-Reasoner employs several preprocessors ({IFC} to {RDF} converter, Geometry Extractor) to build the semantic repository from the input {IFC} model. Once all the triples are generated from the initial data (.ifc file), Stardog is used to build a knowledge graph for the semantic verification. All types of inference and reasoning mechanisms for the semantic verification are applied over this knowledge graph to meet the requirements of verification. Knowledge graph over triplets enables freedom of extending {RDF} based Semantic {IFC} model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation of newer rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with condition and constraints over {IFC} data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the initial data of {IFC} model, etc. Finally, we tested our prototype by using several online {IFC} models. We conclude that semantic technologies provide more rich mechanisms and answer vast types of queries for the verification of {IFC} models. It provides powerful features based on {SPARQL} libraries and serves best for the automated code compliance and verification of {IFC} models.},

	abstract = {Digital planning methods are changing the needs of construction stakeholders. It should be as easy as possible to compare product data from different manufacturers and integrate them into the planning model without detours. Web technologies not only offer great potential to enhance existing ways of working, but also open up new business models for product manufacturers in the service and {IOT} domains. However, manufacturers have a legitimate interest to retain control over the disclosure of their product data. Therefore, it is often only available offline and on demand. Of technical interest are therefore solutions, in which a large part of the data autonomy and access control remains on the side of the manufacturer, but the project planner is allowed to search the product data of all manufacturers like an interconnected system. Frequently, such a searchability is ensured by a uniform data schema and storage of the data in a central storage location, a so-called data warehouse. Nonetheless, this stands in contrast to the natural interest of the manufacturer for data sovereignty. This paper focuses on systems that can replace centralized data storage with distributed data management on manufacturer-owned servers, without losing accessibility for planners. Manufacturers should have as much freedom of implementation as possible when establishing the security concept, modeling their data and integrating the proposed approach into their operating procedure.},

To this end, a {BIM}-based approach is developed, which connects a user-friendly industry-standard {BIM} software with effective simulation tools for high-performance computing.

We consider the use of ontologies to be better suited for representing such complex systems, paving the way toward semantic digital twins of the construction site by including concepts beyond traditional 3D model data, such as actors, sensors, management workflows, information over the web, etc. Most importantly, access to web distributed resources can be used for intelligent processing and logic reasoning, bypassing the {BIM} legacy tools and formats which are becoming more and more limited in an increasingly interconnected world. To address these challenges, we propose a 4D {BIM} platform architecture that is able to encompass semantic web models representing the building and the construction scheduling information, which are further enriched by the semantics of collaboration planning meeting contexts. The system architecture is comprised of several layers, each of which are presented and discussed.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.eij.2020.02.008},
	abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an indoor navigation support system based on the Building Information Models ({BIM}) paradigm. Although {BIM} is initially defined for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction/Facility Management ({AEC}/{FM}) industry, the authors believe that it can provide added value in this context. To this end, the authors will focus on the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) standard for the formal representation of {BIM}. The approach followed in this paper will be based on the {ifcOWL} ontology, which translates the {IFC} schemas into Ontology Web Language ({OWL}). Several modifications of this ontology have been proposed, consisting of the inclusion of new items, {SWRL} rules and {SQWRL} searches. This way of expressing the elements of a building can be used to code information that is very useful for navigation, such as the location of elements related to the actions desired by the user. It is important to note that this design is intended to be used as a complement to other well-known tools and techniques for indoor navigation. The proposed modifications have been successfully tested in a variety of simulated and real scenarios. The main limitation of the proposal is the immense amount of information contained in the {ifcOWL} ontology, which causes difficulties involving its processing and the time necessary to perform operations on it. Those elements that are considered important have been selected, removing those that seem secondary to navigation. This procedure will result in a significant reduction in the storage and semantic processing of the information. Thus, for a system with 1000 individuals (in the ontological sense), the processing time is about 90 s. The authors regard this time as acceptable, since in most cases the tasks involved can be considered part of the system initialization, meaning they will only be executed once at the beginning of the process.},

Tremendous savings can be achieved by deploying building management services during operation, however, the manual deployment of these services needs to be undertaken by experts and it is a tedious, time and cost consuming task. It requires detailed expert knowledge to match the diverse requirements of services with the present constellation of envelope, equipment and automation system in a target building. To enable the widespread deployment of these services, this knowledge-intensive task needs to be automated. Knowledge-based methods solve this task, however, their widespread adoption is hampered and solutions proposed in the past do not stick to basic principles of state of the art knowledge engineering methods. To fill this gap we present a novel methodological approach for the design of knowledge-based systems for the automated deployment of building management services. The approach covers the essential steps and best practices: (1) representation of terminological knowledge of a building and its systems based on well-established knowledge engineering methods; (2) representation and capturing of assertional knowledge on a real building portfolio based on open standards; and (3) use of the acquired knowledge for the automated deployment of building management services to increase the energy efficiency of buildings during operation. We validate the methodological approach by deploying it in a real-world large-scale European pilot on a diverse portfolio of buildings and a novel set of building management services.

The proposed ontology was evaluated using a sample dataset of the architectural maintenance work records of an office building. Using the proposed approach, facility managers will be able to increase their efficiency in searching related work records that consider shared {BIM} objects by enhancing the interoperability and accessibility of {FM} data via the Semantic Web.},

	abstract = {Each domain industry requires the detailed specifications for sharing and exchanging building information models throughout the design, construction, and operation phases. Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) Model View Definitions ({MVDs}) specify required information for exchanges of building model data among building project experts. The data involves the identification of model semantics shared by two or more applications. However, since no robust standard for defining building semantics and requirements for data exchange has been agreed upon, information embedded in domain-specific {MVDs} are generated separately and are vague in scope, which results in a lack of consistency. In addition, the Information Delivery Manual ({IDM}) that includes exchange specifications needed for each exchange process of a product model is manually defined in a paper-based document. Because there is no clear logical link between the units of information in the exchange requirements of an {IDM}, and those of {MVDs}, the mapping that translates requirements of an {IDM} into ones of an {MVD} is open to various interpretation, without semantic and logical consistency. Such challenges might result in redundant requirements and rules for data exchange that are not supposed to be handled in the process of {MVDs}. To ameliorate this situation, this research proposes the new approach of formalizing domain knowledge and defining accurate data modules for model views. To achieve this goal, the authors employed ontological principles for generating an {IDM} for the precast concrete domain and for linking its {MVD} with formal information models. The formalized structure of domain knowledge is expected to support defining explicit data modules and developing manageable relationships among entities using semantic reasoning so that domain professionals and software vendors can identify the intents of the requirements of mapped {MVDs} and keep track of mapping problems. Moreover, to integrate {IDM} and {MVD} development processes, the ontology-based {IDM} is parsed and translated from {OWL}/{XML} to {mvdXML}, which automatically generates {MVD} documentation in the {IfcDoc} tool.},

In the Semantic Web, all data instances and data schema are stored in a graph data store, which makes it easy to merge data from different sources.

	abstract = {Abstract In response to the growing concerns about climate change and the environment, sustainable design of buildings is increasingly demanded by building owners and users. However, fast evaluation of various design options and identification of the optimized design requires application of design analysis tools such as energy modeling, daylight simulations, and natural ventilation analysis software. Energy analysis requires access to distributed sources of information such as building element material properties provided by designers, mechanical equipment information provided by equipment manufacturers, weather data provided by weather reporting agencies, and energy cost data from energy providers. Gathering energy related information from different sources and inputting the information to an energy analysis application is a time consuming process. This causes delays and increases the time for comparing different design alternatives. This paper discusses how Semantic Web technology can facilitate information collection from several sources for energy analysis. Semantic Web enables sharing, accessing, and combining information over the Internet in a machine process-able format. This would free building designers to concentrate on building design optimization rather than spending time on data preparation and manual entry into energy analysis applications.},

A construction project requires collaboration of different organizations such as owner, designer, contractor, and resource suppliers. These organizations need to exchange information to improve their teamwork. Understanding the information created in other organizations requires specialized human resources. Construction cost estimating is one of the processes that requires information collected from several sources including a building information model ({BIM}) created by designers, estimating assembly and work item information maintained by contractors, and construction resource cost information provided by resource suppliers. Currently, it is not easy for computers to integrate the information for construction cost estimating over the Internet. This study discusses a new approach to construction cost estimating that uses the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web technology provides a data modeling format and the required infrastructure that enables accessing, combining, and sharing information over the Internet in a machine processable format. The estimating approach presented in this study relies on {BIM}, estimating knowledge, and construction material cost data to be represented in the Semantic Web. The approach presented in this study makes the various sources of cost estimating data accessible as Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language ({SPARQL}) endpoints or semantic web services. This study presents an estimating approach that integrates distributed information provided by project designers, contractors, and material suppliers for preparing cost estimates. The purpose of this study is not to fully automate the estimating process but to streamline it by reducing human involvement in repetitive cost estimating activities.},

	abstract = {The World Wide Web has provided a vast distributed information space that is primarily designed for human consumption. The enmeshment of the Web and various business processes has made it imperative to define business information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception; construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information, it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently, the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFCs}) data model. Several researchers have investigated the limitations of {IFCs} data model for interoperability among heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared building ontology that models building domain element types and element relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element properties to the shared building ontology. {SWRL} rules are used for mapping element properties from one domain to another. An example demonstrates how the developed approach can facilitate project information sharing between design and estimating domains.},

Despite the successful applications of {BIM} in the design and construction stages, the use of {BIM} for preconstruction planning has not gained wide acceptance as in other project phases. The integration of {BIM} and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the planning process during the design and preconstruction stages. However, this integration suffers from a lack of interoperability across the geospatial and {BIM} domains. Semantic web technology is used in this study to convey meaning, which is interpretable by both construction project participants as well as {BIM} and geographic information systems ({GIS}) applications processing the transferred data. To achieve this, we first translate building's elements and {GIS} data into a semantic web data format. Then we use a set of standardized ontologies for construction operations to integrate and query the heterogeneous spatial and temporal data. Finally, we use a query language to access and acquire the data in semantic web format. Through two scenario examples, the potential usefulness of the proposed methodology is validated.},

Current estimating software programs maintain a large database of resource cost data which must be updated before starting new estimates. The process of updating such databases is both time consuming and error prone. This paper discusses the architecture of a new approach to construction cost estimating using the semantic web technology. The semantic web technology structures data according to formal ontologies intended to promote machine understanding. Semantic web services provide interfaces for publishing information. The proposed estimating approach requires that suppliers encapsulate their product information within appropriate interfaces and make this information available to contractors through web services. Estimating software applications can retrieve the latest cost data from suppliers’ web services. The paper discusses how ontologies can be used to publish product information and develop ontology-based estimating applications. {INTRODUCTION} A building construction project is a collection of work items that produce building elements. To estimate the cost of a work item in a project, one needs to know the item quantity and the unit costs of the necessary resources. Current estimating applications keep a built-in database of resource (material, equipment, and labor) costs as shown in Figure 1. Item quantities are digitally extracted from a building model. Resource costs continuously change; however, current estimating applications do not have the built-in capability to update their cost databases. Therefore, estimators must obtain the latest resource costs from suppliers and manually update estimating application databases, which is a time consuming process.},

These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling ({BIM}) software. The usage of these technologies in the {AEC} domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the {AEC} domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the {AEC} domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the {AEC} domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the {AEC} domains. Results show that semantic web technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g. {BIM} + Infra + {GIS} + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2) devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures.},

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, {BIM} lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of {BIM} during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.},

	abstract = {Building construction industry has significant impact on sustainability. The construction, operation and maintenance of buildings account for approximately 50\% of global energy usage and anthropogenic greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions. In recent years, the embodied energy and carbon are identified increasingly important in terms of sustainability throughout building life cycle. Incorporation of sustainable development in building structural design becomes undoubtedly crucial. The effective building design requires smart and holistic tools that can process multi-objective and inter-connected domain knowledge to provide genuine sustainable buildings. 
With the advancement of information and communication technologies, various methods and techniques have been applied to accomplish the multiple objectives of sustainable development in building design. One of the most successful approaches is building information modelling ({BIM}), which requires further enhancement of interoperability. The emergence of Semantic Web technology provides more opportunity to improve the information modelling, knowledge management and system integration. 
The research presented in this thesis investigates how ontology and Semantic Web rules can be used in a knowledge-based holistic system, in order to integrate information about structural design and sustainability, and facilitate decision-making in design process by recommending appropriate solutions for different use cases. A research prototype namely {OntoSCS} incorporating {OWL} ontology and {SWRL} rules has been developed and tested in typical structural design cases. The holistic approach considers five inter-connected dimensions of sustainability, including structural feasibility, embodied energy and carbon, cost, durability and safety. In addition, the selection of structural material supplier and criteria in sustainability assessment are taken into account as well. This research concludes that the Semantic Web technology can be applied to structural design at early stage to provide multi-criteria optimised solution. The methodology and framework employed in this study can be further adapted as a generic multi-criteria and holistic decision support system for other domains in construction sector.},

	abstract = {Abstract As Building Information Modeling evolves into becoming the central mean for coordinating project design and planning activities, we notice a few limitations/opportunities in the way current {BIM} tools address the needs for integrated design, collaboration and analysis (the initial objective of {BIM}). First, substantial communications and interactions about the design exist outside the {BIM} environment — typically in e-mail formats. This may cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste valuable knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need of engaging end-users and their keen interest in selecting “green” features. Professionals can develop different designs that achieve varying levels of energy conservation, but these will always require changes based on usage patterns. So, it is important that end-users are involved in the design process early on to make sure that they receive adequate information/ education before they make decisions. This is the nature of limitations that we try to address in this research. This paper builds around the design and development of an online system, named Green2.0 that tries to leverage advancements in Building Information Models ({BIM}), energy-efficiency simulation tools, and online social network analysis methods to enable a data-driven approach to building planning, construction and maintenance. Fundamentally, it allows participants (end-users or professionals) to comment and share views about building designs. Social network analysis and semantic modeling tools are then used to extract information from these interactions. At the same time, it connects {BIM} to energy analysis software to allow users to select different products from a catalog and assess the impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that {AEC} professionals, end-users and public policy makers work together throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an open platform, it provides access to information that enables researchers and practitioners to build new, more efficient theories and methods of building design. The premise of our work is that by providing new insights into the building design process it is likely to have a profound beneficial effect for both {AEC} professionals and the society at large.},

However, in the buildings domain, the integration of rule-based performance metrics and contextual information has yet to be formally established. This paper describes an approach to the provision of in-depth building performance assessment through the integration of {OpenMath} and linked data. An ontology describing performance metrics in {RDF} is presented, together with an automated metric evaluation solution using multi-silo queries and computer algebra systems, providing a flexible, automated and extensible mechanism for the assessment of building performance. Building managers and engineers can simultaneously analyse time-series building performance at a range of levels, without burdensome manual intervention such as is the case with traditional solutions. A test implementation on a large university building highlights the potential of this solution.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the last decade, the paradigm Historical Building Information Modeling ({HBIM}) was investigated to exploit the possibilities offered by the application of {BIM} to historical buildings. In the Cultural Heritage domain, the {BIM}-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a workflow that exploits the advantages of {BIM} platforms and Semantic-Web technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of semantically structured and rich {HBIM} data. The presented pipeline follows four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and, later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model, providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with appropriate {LOD} and Grade in {BIM} environment and then guarantee a complete interoperability with {IFC}/{RDF} format. Relying on semantically structured data (ontologies) and on the Linked Data stack appears a valid approach for addressing existing information system issues in the {CH} domain and constitutes a step forward in the management of repositories and web libraries devoted to historical buildings.},

	doi = {10.1109/TII.2017.2708727},
	abstract = {With the rapidly growing number of online product models in construction industry, there is an urgent need for developing effective domain-specific information retrieval methods. Explicit semantic analysis ({ESA}) is a method that automatically extracts concept-based features from human knowledge repositories for semantic retrieval. This avoids the requirement of constructing and maintaining an explicitly formalized ontology. However, since domain-specific knowledge repositories are relatively small, the available terminologies are insufficient and concepts have coarse granularity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced {ESA} method for product model retrieval in construction industry. The major enhancements for the original {ESA} method consist of two parts. First, a novel concept expansion algorithm is proposed to solve the problem caused by insufficient terminologies. Second, a reranking algorithm is developed to solve the problem caused by coarse granularity of concepts. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of product model retrieval and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also applicable to product retrieval in other engineering domain if a specific knowledge repository is provided in that domain.},

	abstract = {Energy management systems in buildings and their district today use automation systems and artificial intelligence ({AI}) solutions for smart energy management, but they fail to achieve the desired results due to the lack of holistic and optimised decision-making. A reason for this is the silo-oriented approach to the decision-making failing to consider cross-domain data. Ontologies, as a new way of processing domain knowledge, have been increasingly applied to different domains using formal and explicit knowledge representation to conduct smart decision-making. In this {PhD} research, Real-time Multiscale Smart Energy Management and Optimisation ({REMO}) ontology was developed, as a cross-domain knowledge-base, which consequently can be used to support holistic real-time energy management in districts considering both demand and supply side optimisation. The ontology here, is also presented as the core of a proposed framework which facilitates the running of {AI} solutions and automation systems, aiming to minimise energy use, emissions, and costs, while maintaining comfort for users. The state of the art {AI} solutions for prediction and optimisation were concluded through authors involvement in European Union research projects. The {AI} techniques were independently validated through action research and achieved about 30 - 40 \% reduction in energy demand of the buildings, and 36\% reduction in carbon emissions through optimisation of the generation mix in the district. 
The research here also concludes a smart way to capture the generic knowledge behind {AI} models in ontologies through rule axiom features, which also meant this knowledge can be used to replicate these {AI} models in future sites. Both semantic and syntactic validation were performed on the ontology before demonstrating how the ontology supports the various use cases of the framework for holistic energy management. Further development of the framework is recommended for the future which is needed for it to facilitate real-time energy management and optimisation in buildings and their district.},

However, current urban modeling approaches often use abstract and low level information to describe buildings because of the difficulties of collecting and managing building data on the large scale required of such urban communities. This abstraction of building data creates large uncertainties in the modeling and simulation of energy scenarios at the community level. An important part of the solution to this challenge relies on the integration of information systems at the scale of both urban communities and individual buildings, which are based on geographic information system ({GIS}) and building information modeling ({BIM}) respectively. Since current technologies do not sufficiently address the interoperability between {GIS} and {BIM}, the existing conversion between {GIS} and {BIM} does not satisfy the data requirements for community energy design. This paper investigates this challenge and presents an approach that uses semantic web technologies, including web ontology language ({OWL}) and resource description framework ({RDF}), to integrate {GIS} and {BIM} data. In this approach, we use an extract, transform and load ({ETL}) tool to convert {GIS} and {BIM} data to {RDF} and conduct queries on the integrated {RDF} to provide the required information for energy simulation. The approach is tested through a case study of the University of British Columbia campus.},

We study how to assign unique and stable identities to anonymous nodes based on signatures generated from their graph environment, and present the Short Paths Crossings Algorithm ({SPCA}) that computes sets of paths with limited length from anonymous nodes taking into account their crossings. Empirical tests show that {SPCA} produces significantly smaller difference sets for {IFC}-derived graphs than previous algorithms for {RDF} change detection.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) and Semantic Web technologies are becoming more and more popular in the Architecture Engineering Construction ({AEC}) and Facilities Management ({FM}) industry to support information management, information exchange and data interoperability. One of the key integration gateways between {BIM} and Semantic Web is represented by the {ifcOWL} ontology, i.e. the Web Ontology Language ({OWL}) version of the {IFC} standard, being one of reference technical standard for {AEC}/{FM}. Previous studies have shown how a recommended {ifcOWL} ontology can be automatically generated by converting the {IFC} standard from the official {EXPRESS} schema. However, the resulting {ifcOWL} is a large monolithic ontology that presents serious limitations for real industrial applications in terms of usability and performance (i.e. querying and reasoning). Possible enhancements to reduce the complexity and the data size consist in (1) modularization of {ifcOWL} making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology, and (2) rethinking the contents and structure of an ontology for {AEC}/{FM} to better fit in the semantic web scope and make its usage more efficient. The second approach can be enabled by the first one, since it would make it easier to replace some of the {ifcOWL} modules with new optimized ontologies for the {AEC}-{FM} industry. This paper focuses on the first approach presenting a method to automatically generate a modular {ifcOWL} ontology. The method aims at minimizing the dependencies between modules to better exploit the modularization. The results are compared with simpler and more straight-forward solutions.},

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an {EXPRESS} schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the {IFC} standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language ({OWL}) ontology for {IFC} (termed {ifcOWL}) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established {IFC} standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an {ifcOWL} ontology from the {EXPRESS} schemas of {IFC} and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable {ifcOWL} ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an {EXPRESS}-to-{OWL} converter and the key features of the resulting {ifcOWL} ontology.},

While technological advances have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema which would reduce the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different buildings. Recent attempts have sought to address this issue through data standards and metadata schemes, but fail to capture the set of relationships and entities required by real applications. Building upon these works, this paper describes Brick, a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight complex unmodified applications on these buildings.},

We propose Plaster, an open and modular framework that incorporates existing advances in building metadata normalization. It provides unified programming interfaces for various types of learning methods for metadata normalization and defines standardized data models for building metadata and timeseries data. Thus, it enables the integration of different methods via a workflow, benchmarking of different methods via unified interfaces, and rapid prototyping of new algorithms. With Plaster, we 1) show three examples of the workflow integration, delivering better performance than individual algorithms, 2) benchmark/analyze five algorithms over five common buildings, and 3) exemplify the process of developing a new algorithm involving time series features. We believe Plaster will facilitate the development of new algorithms and expedite the adoption of standard metadata schema such as Brick, in order to enable seamless smart building applications in the future.},

A crucial part of the building permit process is the interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other countries and their projects have developed a certain type of rule-translation methods, {KBimCode}, part of the {KBim} application series, has been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an automatic, {BIM}-based building permit system on top of the current e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule reviewers.

	abstract = {Automated rule checking has been identified as potentially providing significant value to the {AEC} industry from both regulatory and industry perspectives. Key challenges to a successful rule checking implementation are the complexities inherent in the rules themselves and the breadth of conditions to which they need to apply. Due to the large number of building codes and theoretically infinite number of rules that can be defined, it is critical to systematize the rules to make the task of rule checking tractable. This paper is a first step towards classifying automated rule checking. In this paper, the authors draw upon their extensive international exposure with various building codes and rule checking areas in the {AEC} domain to introduce a general classification of rules across application domains using criteria that apply to all known aspects of automated rule checking. The exposure covers both academic research as well as actual production implementation done with {CORENET} {ePlanCheck} project in Singapore, and also various pilot implementations in the {US} and other countries. The authors offer a survey of representative examples of different classes of rules, their key concepts, potential tools required to implement them, and at least one possible solution of each example rule in each category. The examples are drawn from both research domains and existing commercial applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial guide for creating a framework for rule classification that articulates both the process challenges and the technology needs to address rule automation.},

approach for a translator of {KBimCode} as a part of a {BIM}-enabled
automated design rule checking system. {KBimCode} is an explicit and
computer-readable form written in a scripting language to represent
Korea Building Act sentences. {KBimCode} separates the rule-making
process that conventionally dependent on rule-checking software.
Based on the approach, {KBimCode} implemented with its own logic rule
components and has been managed with the database. On the other hand,
there are several rule-checking software executed with their own rule set.
Translating natural language rules into the rule set of each software and
translating a rule of specific software into others require a lot of manual
effort. The manual translation also hinders interoperability between
rule checking software. We address the problem with developing the
{KBimCode} translator for each rule checking software. In this research,
we focused on translating {KBimCode} into an executable code of specific
rule checking software, named {KBimAssess}. {KBimCode} translator
will integrate the rule-making and rule-checking process, which means
various stakeholders, even who are not familiar with programming,
can easily conduct {BIM}-enabled rule checking by utilizing {KBimCode}.
Furthermore, the implementation of {KBimCode} translator is expected
to contribute to the enhancement of interoperability between various
rule-checking applications.},

A final complex alignment method is proposed to recognize the instance groups belonging to a regulatory requirement, in which (1) supervised and unsupervised searching algorithms are used to identify the instance pairs, and (2) network modeling is used to group and link the instance pairs to the requirement.

	abstract = {The nation’s massive underground utility infrastructure must comply with a multitude of regulations. The regulatory compliance checking of underground utilities requires an objective and consistent interpretation of the regulations. However, utility regulations contain a variety of domain-specific terms and numerous spatial constraints regarding the location and clearance of underground utilities. It is challenging for the interpreters to understand both the domain and spatial semantics in utility regulations. To address the challenge, this paper adopts an ontology and rule-based Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) framework to automate the interpretation of utility regulations – the extraction of regulatory information and the subsequent transformation into logic clauses. Two new ontologies have been developed. The urban product ontology ({UPO}) is domain-specific to model domain concepts and capture domain semantics on top of heterogeneous terminologies in utility regulations. The spatial ontology ({SO}) consists of two layers of semantics – linguistic spatial expressions and formal spatial relations – for better understanding the spatial language in utility regulations. Pattern-matching rules defined on syntactic features (captured using common {NLP} techniques) and semantic features (captured using ontologies) were encoded for information extraction. The extracted information elements were then mapped to their semantic correspondences via ontologies and finally transformed into deontic logic ({DL}) clauses to achieve the semantic and logical formalization. The approach was tested on the spatial configuration-related requirements in utility accommodation policies. Results show it achieves a 98.2\% precision and a 94.7\% recall in information extraction, a 94.4\% precision and a 90.1\% recall in semantic formalization, and an 83\% accuracy in logical formalization.},

Still, automated code compliance checking has not yet been fully realized, as there is no standardized method for rule interpretation and building model preparation for code compliance. Manual verification of design code compliance, meanwhile, requires significant effort and time and is error-prone, while uncertainty and inconsistency in assessment lead to delays in the construction process. In this paper, the development of a prototype to automate municipal bylaw and wall framing code compliance checking for residential building is presented. The building rules have been classified into three groups based on the complexity involved in translation into computer-readable format and complexity in retrieving the required information, and they are represented based on building objects, which makes the regulations easier to understand and assists in translating the regulations into a computer-readable format. By creating a model view based on the required element's parameters extracted from a model for checking purposes, the prototype application offers automated code compliance checking functionality to validate designs based on building code requirements and construction engineering specifications. The implementation of the prototype and its benefits compared to manual checking is demonstrated.},

The automation of code compliance checking process has been explored since 1960s and becoming more vigorous with the emergence of Building Information Modeling ({BIM}). A neutral format, Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) which is developed under {BIM} platform had led to better collaboration and information exchange throughout {BIM} software and development of the checking system. Generally, the structure of an automated system consists of rule interpretation stage, building model preparation stage, rule execution stage and rule reporting stage. Rule interpretation stage is the most vital and complex stage. In interpreting the rules, various techniques have been investigated and applied to employ comprehensive and accurate checking process on the building designs which are mainly in {IFC} format. The most common techniques used are by utilizing existing software such as Solibri Model Checker, establishing a plug-in application, adopting object-based approach, logical approach and ontological approach. This paper provides a highlight and review on previous studies which successfully employed the appropriate techniques in interpreting the rules for checking purposes. This will subsequently assist future research on this area and create more astounding code compliance checking system.},

Existing semantic web technology may be able to overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of {IFC} as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building design and construction.

This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction ({AEC}) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design ({CAD}) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models ({BIMs}), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class ({IFC}). {IFC} has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the {IFC} data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for England and Wales.},

	abstract = {During the design and construction phases of building projects, domain experts iteratively exchange building information models. One of their goals is to ensure that the requirements and objectives of a proposed project are satisfied. In addition, most building information modeling software currently implements heterogeneous mapping processes in their {IFC} interfaces that bind their native models to the {IFC} format. However, such exchanges frequently do not realize intended geometric transformations, project requirements, and required syntactic and semantic conditions in building model data, exacerbating the problem of model integrity and resulting in expensive changes during the construction and operation phases. These problematic issues have been addressed by the development of solid frameworks for validating a building design. This paper surveys six currently available applications for validating building design data and identifies their strengths and weaknesses: The Express Engine's {EXPRESSO}, the {JDSAI}™, the {EXPRESS} Data Manager™, the {IFC} server {ActiveX} Component, the {IfcDoc}, and the Solibri Model Checker®. We also structured the validation processes into three types of tasks: 1) a syntax check of the assurance of compliance with the {IFC} schema defined by the {EXPRESS} language, 2) semantic and syntactic assessment in terms of conformity to model view definitions, which consist of concept modularizations, and 3) the validation of design programming requirements that evaluates regulations, project criteria, owner requirements, and functional performance. The purpose of this survey, based on available software that supports the validation of building model data for these three types of interoperability issues, is to integrate diverse checking approaches, as a basis for improving what are now widely distributed efforts.},

However, due to the large amount of regulation needs considered, the construction quality compliance checking against regulations can be cumbersome/time-consuming and error prone. In order to give more computerized support to the construction quality compliance checking against regulations, an ontology-based semantic modeling approach of regulation constraints is explored. A meta model for construction quality inspection and evaluation i.e. {CQIEOntology} is proposed in this paper. Based on {CQIEontology}, the regulation constraints are modeled into {OWL} axioms and {SWRL} rules. By these {OWL} axioms and {SWRL} rules, the regulation provisions imposed on construction quality inspection can be translated into a set of inspection tasks, and get associated with the specific construction tasks. Once the construction starts, the applicable inspection tasks, including a series of quality checking and evaluation, will be reminded and recommended. Obviously, the proposed approach facilitates taking the construction quality compliance checking as a paralleling activity to the construction rather than an afterthought, and helps the inspectors in quality inspection. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in Protégé 3.4.6 through case studies based on regulation examples taken from “Code for Acceptance of Construction Quality of Building Foundation ({GB}50202-2002) and the validation and discussion are given for it.”},

This paper introduces an ontological approach to support the plan definition and verification process. Using this approach, the technical plans are modeled into plan ontology in a layered modeling structure. The verification knowledge is modeled into ontology axioms and semantic rules. A case example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach for pit excavation. In addition, the proposed approach enables the compliance verification process to be undertaken in parallel with the technical plan definition. As a result, the plans' compliance can be ensured during the project delivery process.

The following concepts for {BMC} were identified: A) Compliance checking solutions, separated into: 1) Validation checking and 2) Content checking, and B) Design solution checking, separated into: 3) Smart objects checking and 4) Design option checking. All concepts are presented with principles and examples, and as Linked Data with {RDF}-graph. The impact of this overview can contribute to improved understanding of {BMC}, improved understanding and clarification of expectations, and joint terms for common use.},

	url = {http://www.itcon.org/paper/2016/24},
	abstract = {Specifications of the exact requirements for {BIM}-based rules are often much more complex than it appears from their direct language interpretation. It is because the complete rule interpretation involves knowledge from human experts. Therefore, detailed interpretation process of rules for the purpose of automated rule checking implementation must be able to capture such knowledge and it must be retained throughout the implementation process. In order to ensure both completeness and precision, the knowledge capture needs to be formalized. We propose a formalized way to capture these requirements using a knowledge representation approach. Detailed analysis of the structure of the rules points to the conceptual graph ({CG}) as a suitable method for this purpose due to its expressiveness, which allows unambiguous description of the requirements. Such unambiguous description can be understood by all the participants in the implementation efforts. The conceptual graph is a representation that conforms to the first order logic that makes it suitable for the job. Using the conceptual graph, rules can be broken into their atomic rules and incorporates the unwritten domain checking knowledge that if done right will remove ambiguities that often plague building codes. It also provides a standardized way to capture and document the model data requirements and the high level checking logic as their functional requirements. With this, a layer that often separates the rule experts and the implementers can be eliminated, resulting in clarity and immediate usefulness for the implementation. The validity of this assertion is demonstrated using the comparison to the actual corresponding implementation of the rules.},

	volume = {21},
	url = {http://www.itcon.org/paper/2016/25},
	abstract = {In the {AEC} industry, there is a large number of standards and codes which ensure the structural stability, reliability, usability of the building under design. Accordingly, checking the conformity of the building design with these requirements is a crucial process. Nowadays this checking is performed to a large extent manually based on two-dimensional technical drawings and textual documents. Due to the low level of automation, the conventional checking procedure is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone. As Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) becomes more and more mature, a suitable digital information basis also becomes available to enable automating the process. The commercial solutions for code compliance checking available so far mainly follow a black-box approach where the rules that make up a certain regulation are implemented in a hard-wired fashion rendering their implementation in-transparent and non-extendable. A number of researchers have tackled this problem and have proposed various ways that allow the user to define rules, either in a standard programming language or in a dedicated language. However, {AEC} domain experts usually do not have the required programming skills to use these languages appropriately. To overcome this issue, we introduce the Visual Code Checking Language ({VCCL}), which uses a graphical notation in order to represent the rules of a code in a machine- and human-readable language. The paper presents the features and functionalities of the {VCCL} in detail and shows its application in a number of case studies.},

	abstract = {Accurate and valid data is essential during the development of building projects and throughout the use phase of buildings. This study proposes a framework to help owners and facility managers in: (a) defining the requirements for asset management tasks in a structured way; (b) validating project and asset data against the established requirements; and (c) visualising asset data, stored in different and distributed sources, in an integrated and interactive way to support specific asset/facility management functions (e.g. maintenance tasks). The framework combines the use of Information Delivery Manual ({IDM}), Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}), Construction Operations Building Information Exchange ({COBie}), and Content Management Interoperability Services ({CMIS}) in the development of Asset Information Models ({AIM}) to fulfil the owner’s requirements (Asset Information Requirements) throughout the lifecycle of a building. An {AIM} is a data model that contains all digital data (graphical, non-graphical, and documentary) required to operate an asset or portfolio of assets. Validation methods are identified for each of the {AIM} data types and a method for their integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual environment.
The proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the validation of the various data sources against the client requirements, defined in the Asset Information Requirement ({AIR}); and (2) the visualisation of asset data required for a maintenance task in an interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the capability of the framework to enable the definition of {AIR} and the validation of the different {AIM}’s data deliverables. The visualisation of the {AIM} data - from different and distributed sources - for a maintenance task was successfully performed in an integrated and interactive game environment. Future work will consider other data sources and will evaluate the proposed framework using real industrial data.},

Furthermore, the design of healthcare facilities is highly constrained by regulations containing a wide range of requirements. Using {BIM} for automated rule checking has been pointed out as an opportunity to improve requirements management in these projects. However, most existing research is focused on hard-coded approaches or on limited sets of requirements. The aim of this investigation is to propose a semantic-based framework for automated rule checking in the context of healthcare design. An empirical study was conducted in the redevelopment of a university hospital, using Design Science Research as a methodological approach. Results indicate that the nature of regulations and the subjectivity of requirements have a major impact on the possibility of their translation into logical rules, which is needed to enable automated checking. The main theoretical contribution is a taxonomy for automated rule checking and information transformation.},

	abstract = {A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real building data stored in an industry specific format (the {IFCs}). The adoption of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of the regulation scheme within 18months. We believe that these positive results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible benefits.},

	abstract = {The upsurge of design complexity through the application of Building Information Modelling ({BIM}) leads to various development of automation in designing and construction processes including automation in the compliance checking process. The compliance of building designs to fire safety regulations holds an utmost importance to ensure adequate fire safety level in the building. The automation in compliance checking process could save significant time and cost as well as avoid inaccuracies. Since regulations are commonly written in human linguistic format, the semantics of the regulations need to be captured and extracted to translate them into computer interpretable rules. This paper demonstrates the process in capturing the semantics of fire safety regulations in Selangor Uniform Building By-Laws 1984 through the adoption of knowledge formalisation method. A framework was developed to provide a comprehensive guideline in capturing the semantics for the classification of fire safety regulations. The framework affirms the reliability of executing this method for other building regulations.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) offers the potential to transform our lives in radical ways. However, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even underestimate what various technologies in {AI} are capable of today. Certainly, the translation from scientific papers and benchmark performance to products is faster in {AI} than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is often the case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. This document describes an example-based methodology to categorise and assess several {AI} technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels ({TRL}) (e.g., maturity and availability levels). We first interpret the nine {TRLs} in the context of {AI} and identify different categories in {AI} to which they can be assigned. We then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness-vs-generality charts, where we see that higher {TRLs} are achievable for low-generality technologies focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while low {TRLs} are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of {AI} technologies in a variety of fields, and show their readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as a base for a broader discussion of {AI} technologies. Finally, we use the dynamics of several {AI} technology at different generality levels and moments of time to forecast some short-term and mid-term trends for {AI}.},

These guidelines offer a comprehensive description of the tasks to perform, including a list of steps, tools that help in achieving the task, various alternatives for performing the task, and best practices and recommendations. Furthermore, this paper presents a complete example on the generation and publication of Linked Data about energy consumption in buildings, following the presented guidelines, in which the energy consumption data of council sites (e.g., buildings and lights) belonging to the Leeds City Council jurisdiction have been generated and published as Linked Data.},

Buildings are designed, built and operated with increasingly complex technologies. Throughout their life-cycle, they produce vast quantities of data. However, many commercial buildings do not perform as originally intended. This paper presents a semantic web based approach to the performance gap problem, describing how heterogeneous building data sources can be transformed into semantically enriched information. A performance assessment ontology and performance framework (software tool) are introduced, which use this heterogeneous data as a service for a structured performance analysis. The demonstrator illustrates how heterogeneous data can be published semantically and then interpreted using a life-cycle performance framework approach.},

To address these challenges, the Linked Building Data initiative promotes the use of ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in order to create more formal and interoperable {BIMs}. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based extension of such semantic {BIMs} that provides support for imprecise knowledge representation and retrieval. We propose an expressive fuzzy ontology language, and describe how to use a fuzzy reasoning engine in a {BIM} context with selected examples. The resulting fuzzy semantic {BIM} enables new functionalities in the project design and analysis stages—namely, soft integration of cross-domain knowledge, flexible {BIM} query, and imprecise parametric modeling.},

	abstract = {A construction project requires collaboration of several organizations such as owner, designer, contractor, and material supplier organizations. These organizations need to exchange information to enhance their teamwork. Understanding the information received from other organizations requires specialized human resources. Construction cost estimating is one of the processes that requires information from several sources including a building information model ({BIM}) created by designers, estimating assembly and work item information maintained by contractors, and construction material cost data provided by material suppliers. Currently, it is not easy to integrate the information necessary for cost estimating over the Internet. This paper discusses a new approach to construction cost estimating that uses Semantic Web technology. Semantic Web technology provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that enables accessing, combining, and sharing information over the Internet in a machine processable format. The estimating approach presented in this paper relies on {BIM}, estimating knowledge, and construction material cost data expressed in a web ontology language. The approach presented in this paper makes the various sources of estimating data accessible as Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language ({SPARQL}) endpoints or Semantic Web Services. We present an estimating application that integrates distributed information provided by project designers, contractors, and material suppliers for preparing cost estimates. The purpose of this paper is not to fully automate the estimating process but to streamline it by reducing human involvement in repetitive cost estimating activities.},

This paper presents an enrichment of the {EXPRESS} to {OWL} conversion patterns with {OWL} class expressions that specifically capture certain constraints of the {IFC} standard. The presented class expressions can be used to improve the robustness of {ifcOWL} and support data integrity, consistency, and applicability across various scenarios of industrial application. In particular, the rules defining the relationships between non-abstract subtypes of {IfcObject} and corresponding subtypes of {IfcTypeObject} are analyzed and converted into novel class expressions. The proposed additions to the conversion pattern have been implemented into a software tool and the resulting ontology was tested against a use case to show the benefits of the new solution with respect to a basic {ifcOWL}. The novel conversion pattern enhances usability of the {ifcOWL} ontology by enabling its direct instantiation, without necessarily going through the intermediate generation of a {STEP} physical format that is then converted into an ontology.},

From planning, design, construction, and facilities or asset management, these latest “tools” are becoming the norm. These technologies are also becoming more prevalent in the infrastructure and transportation industries.

Business owners must be convinced the {ROI} is there and users must see that the learning curve is not so disruptive that it impacts the project schedule. There can also be reluctance to embrace technology designed to address a process that has “always been done that way.” Nearly everyone agrees that {IT} makes sense and it is inevitable in the coming years. The questions that need to be addressed are what to adopt and how to do it remain the primary concerns?

Other types of knowledge, such as those related to functional and behavioral aspects of design, remain tacit or described in ad-hoc terms by relying on structural properties as representational surrogates (e.g. geometry). The lack of a formal, model-based representation of functional knowledge limits the scope of semantics required to provide better computational support in performance-based building design. To address this problem, the research proposes the development of a representational framework for the functional and behavioral characterization of building elements based on the Functional Representation ({FR}) schema, and its formalization under the {DOLCE} foundation ontology. Part of this formalization has been translated into the Web Ontology Language to explore capabilities of {DL} reasoners to support inference of functional interdependencies affecting performance. An overview of the main theoretical background adopted is provided. Preliminary results and future lines of research are also presented.},

	abstract = {The Industry Foundation Class ({IFC}) Model implemented by schema and data format definition in {EXPRESS}
language is the industry standard for open data modeling and exchange. This data model, based on E-R model
with deep object class instance hierarchy for both elements and relationships has presented challenges in
implementing scalable database approaches for managing and serving {BIM} objects while maintaining
requisite relationships necessary for inferring relationships across the complex E-R network. Alternative
models based on alternative data encodings with associated data topologies, database strategies and
supporting tool sets such {IFCXML}, {IFCJSON} and {RDF}/{IFCOWL} have been proposed, with associated
affordances and limitations in terms of semantic richness, validation and querying capability and scalability.
Graph databases are a recent development in modern databasing technology that is gaining prominence in
the broader computing community. Graph databases promise general support of complex entity-relationship
networks in a manner that supports rich semantic inference at scale. Consider those limitations stated above,
this paper propose a method of database mapping between {IFC} Model to Graph database, and presents
opportunities for drawing on graph querying capabilities to develop inferences about the semantic
relationships among objects in {IFC} {BIM} models. The implementation and examination of this mapping is
achieved by translating the {IFC} data and then store them into Neo4j, a commonly used graph database
application. As part of this translation, broadly available {IFC} to {XML} conversion utilities were used to
convert the {BIM} software output to {XM}. A python based parser was developed and used to parse the {IFC}
component information and generate a Cypher script - the structural language for graph database
construction.. This Cypher script - encapsulating the {IFC} E-R model is imported into the Neo4j graph
database in batches with Neo4j-Shell.},

Standards tend to have a very narrow focus of applicability, so growing a system-agnostic domain model involves the integration of several standards (in this case {FSGIM}, {OpenADR}, {IFC}, {SAREF}, {QUDT}, {SOSA}, {NIST} Tariff, and {BRICK}) into a cohesive model. The resulting information layer provides a foundation for round-trip translation, validation, logic, and reasoning, and is part of a cloud-based platform that provides a messaging hub.

As more data is added to a {BIM} model, the complexity and data volume of the model increases. Further, many design changes are made to a building information model during design and construction phases, and it is difficult to extract and visualize the changed objects. Research on the use of ontology in {BIM} is also limited. The purpose of this study therefore is to use an ontology to visualize revised objects in {BIM} models. This research uses the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) format, a widely-supported open standard for building information models. The changed objects in the {BIM} model are extracted by comparing the revised model to the original model, and a model report of the design change is provided. A prototype program using a sample {IFC} model is developed to validate the system. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is valid for the extraction and visualization of design changes in {BIM} models.},

In recent times, Saudi Arabia’s market gasoline prices have dropped dramatically, necessitating the kingdom to establish its 2030 vision. The 2030 vision aims to make Saudi Arabia an ideal sustainable society by reducing its reliance on petrol, creating more sustainable buildings, and using renewable energy resources. Due to the lack of a national rating system in the kingdom, {LEED} will be used as a guideline to formulate a unique rating system suitable for Saudi Arabia and supports the kingdom’s 2030 vision.

study errors in design or work plans. Increasingly, research and applications of
{ARC} are going beyond “box-ticking” compliance with regulatory rules. {ARC} is
no longer just a cost-saving “software tool”, but a money-making “service or
product”. Consequently, instead of the top-down, expert-system-like format,
new forms of {ARC} are semantic-savvy, and are based on (bottom-up) analytics
and machine learning approaches. {ARC} can now be used to automatically
generate the analyses and/or services that consultants or contractors deliver.
In fact, it can now (partially) be used to generate the design or work plans
themselves.
The interest in such types of {ARC} is a reflection of the growing importance and
feasibility of {AI} (artificial intelligence), not just as an advanced form of
sophisticated analysis tools, but as a driver for new business. The ability of
using advanced {AI} approaches in these new types of {ARC} is a key outcome of
the maturity of {BIM} in the industry. Thanks to {IFC} (Industry Foundation
Classes), we now have a data-rich environment, where machine learning and
pattern analysis can help us discover and use rules more effectively.
Companies that master the inclusion, deployment and marketing of {ARC}
capabilities will be more competitive in the new economy. Consequently, the
“business value” of {ARC} is changing. It is poised to be a generator of services/
products not a quality control mechanism. Increasingly, it directly contributes to
realizing new segments in the market. This ranges from products for automated
analyses (including the automation of designs), to products for customization
and delivery of information to customers (analysis-on-demand), to enhancing
real-time management of sites and facilities (intelligent buildings).
However, {ARC} value goes beyond the automation of some technical analyses
within a digitized system (making more software more intelligent). More
importantly, one of the key values of advanced forms of {ARC} is its role in
organizational transformation. The sophisticated considerations and cultural
changes needed to develop and deploy an {ARC} make it an effective linchpin
for enterprise-wide {AI} initiatives. The expertise gained from implementing
advanced {ARC} can be the best testbed for wider reengineering of business
process, automation of workflow, and the deployment of business intelligence
within the firm (or a facility). In other words, the sophistication of {ARC}
implementation will propel the re-making of the firm not just its services. It
changes the firm as it changes its offerings.
To support better understanding of this new reality, this report aims to frame
the business case for {ARC}, with three main considerations: 1) {ARC} is a form of
machine learning system—it is not limited to an expert system tool; 2) {ARC}
includes checking rule compliance and the generation of rules through data
analysis; 3) because of its role in assuring the transformation of enterprises into  the {AI}-savvy economy, the business case analysis should reflect that. The business case should not be made only based on the interest of a technical team (cost savings through partial automation of some technical processes).
Rather, it is to be made to an executive who is considering the customer needs and service offering and, indeed, the future, structure and strategy of the firm.},

	abstract = {Current {PLM} or {BIM} based information systems suffer from a lack of checking components for business rules. One reason is the misunderstanding of the role and nature of business rules, and how they should be treated in a product-centric information system. This paper intends to provide both a process and a related model to build such a component and enrich future systems. Rules and requirements process management enables the unambiguous formalization of implicit knowledge contained in business rules, generally expressed in easily understandable language, and leads to the formal expression of requirements. In this paper, the requirements are considered a consequence of the application of a business rule. A conceptual model is then introduced, called {DALTON} ({DAta} Linked Through Occurrences Network), which supports this process. In this ontology, concepts and product data, coming for instance from an existing product database, are represented using instances and occurrences, connected together with triples built from business rules and requirements according to previous management processes. An experiment involving a set of {SWRL} rules is conducted in the Protégé environment that validates the model and the process.},

This research aims to identify the reasons for the low uptake of {BIM} and to examine the feasibility of {BIM} for building design examination through a focus group interview and workshop. A lack of proper {BIM} training is identified as the most critical barrier to adopting {BIM}. Building design examiners indicate that {BIM} adoption requires consistent efforts with empirical errors, since the existing work processes are not flexible enough to embrace {BIM} instantly without proper {BIM} training. An average of three days can be saved by using {BIM} for a building regulations check. This research revealed that {BIM} is feasible for building regulation checking, and the low uptake is mainly caused by a lack of awareness of the {BIM} capabilities.},

Two {BIM} operational standards required by local building regulations and laws, the Dutch Rgd {BIM} Norm, and the Norwegian Statsbygg {BIM} Manual are used to validate both the {mvdXML} {standardsÕ} capabilities and the tools implementation. The rules from these standards are categorized into different rule types and converted to {mvdXML} templates and rules. These rules are then tested using a prototypical, open source software tool. By combining this tool with a {BCF} server we demonstrate the deployment of such automated checking procedures in real working processes.

	abstract = {One of the most important issues during the planning of a construction project is to maintain the quality of the design planning constantly at a high level. Therefore this quality must be checked continuously in terms of accuracy and compliance to the applicable codes and guidelines throughout the duration of a project. Nowadays this checking process is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone since it is mostly performed manually based on two-dimensional planning and iteratively at each planning change by the responsible planning consultant. Recently, various approaches attempted to automate this highly relevant process with the help of digital methods, such as Building Information Modeling, in order to reduce the amount of work and increase the quality of the planning at the same time. Although this Automated Code Compliance Checking has been implemented using a variety of different methods, most of the existing approaches fail because they represent the information of rules in an insufficient or overly complex manner. In this paper a short analysis of the pros and cons of selected existing approaches is given and subsequently minimal requirements for a successful automation of this process are defined. To counteract the lacks and insufficiencies of existing approaches, a new method is introduced which enables an automation using a flow-based, visual programming language, which we call Visual Code Checking Language ({VCCL}). Finally the practical implementation of a semi-automated compliance check concerning an exemplary German fire code demonstrates the viability of the approach.},

This paper summarises the earlier research initiatives, explores common themes and different approaches used, as well as comparing the strengths and limitations of a number of major code compliance checking tools. Some of these tools have been implemented commercially and others are beginning to be adopted or are in their final stages of development. The paper also examines how readily these tools can be applied in the context of a performance-based code as found in New Zealand. Due to a recent push for innovation and productivity improvement in the {AEC} industry, there is an increased uptake of building information modelling ({BIM}) and the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) open standard data model for interoperability. The availability of high performance personal computers, efficient web-based technology, and new initiatives in legal knowledge representation modelling should make the development of commercial compliance checking systems more viable than ever. However, the quest for an industry agreed unified approach seems to be far from over. Research is being conducted to develop a computer interpretable representation of New Zealand’s performance-based codes using an open standard legal data exchange protocol. This is to be integrated into a web-based {BIM} compliance checking framework. The fire safety clauses of the New Zealand Building Code ({NZBC}) are used in the case study.},

	abstract = {Following decades of research, the potential of automated rule-checking applications for building models to boost the productivity in the {AECO} industry has yet to fully materialize. Most efforts have been dedicated to dealing with the complexities associated with formalizing rules related to building designs for computability. To make automated rule checking applications successful, data availability and accessibility are critical components that must be addressed. Unfortunately, to-date they have not received the same level of attention. 
To lay a solid foundation for a robust environment of automated {BIM}-based rule-checking systems, this paper proposes a novel approach of transforming building data into a simplified schema ({BIMRLSS}) as a means of addressing this critical issue. The paper also describes an implementation of the proposed approach on a traditional database management system, which offers the primary advantage of facilitating high-performance queries and supporting a wide range of query types in real-time. 
More importantly, this approach not only allows alphanumeric data queries, but also enables queries on the geometry by using various spatial operators. Allowing complex spatial-based queries provides a means to significantly simplify the traditional programmatic approach to {BIM}-based rule-checking. This data-focused approach allows us to lower a significant barrier that currently prevents {BIM}-based rule-checking systems from reaching their full potential, making the checking process easier and more robust. To highlight the implications and practical benefits of the proposed method, this paper also demonstrates several application scenarios by utilizing a wide range of queries.},

Among the various applications of building information modeling ({BIM}), we focus on automated design assessment and its rule-making process, which has been performed by both architects and software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach, which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism ({KBimLogic}) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into computer-executable code ({KBimCode}) is a software-independent approach that separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district, permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this approach has been demonstrated by each database and a {GUI}-based application named {KBimLogic}, for generating {KBimCode}. The {KBimCode}, which contains a set of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be imported into our code-checking software ({KBimAssess}) using a specific file format.},

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) and the recent emergence of Internet of Things ({IoT}) applications offer several new insights and decision-making capabilities throughout the life cycle of the built environment. In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of {BIM} to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies.},

	abstract = {The strength of Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) in achieving sustainable buildings is well recognized by the global construction industry. However, current understanding of the state-of-the-art green {BIM} research is still limited. In particular, a focus study on how {BIM} contribute to green building design through building performance analysis ({BPA}) is not available. This paper aims to provide systematic and comprehensive insights on current trends and future potentials of green {BIM} research by analyzing the existing literature with their research features (i.e. research backgrounds, goals, methods and outputs). In total, 80 publications have been collected, analyzed and discussed. The results show that among ten main {BPA} types, energy \& thermal analysis, green building rating analysis, and cost and benefit analysis are the most studied. However, wind \& ventilation analysis, acoustic analysis, and water efficiency analysis receive little attention. Moreover, more research focusing on integrated design analysis should be carried out for optimal design outcome. In addition, most of the collected literature research on the capability of data integration and analysis of green {BIM} tools, while their capability of visualization and documentation has limited examination. Furthermore, most researchers utilized one main software package while utilization of information exchange formats ({IEF}) is limited. To increase interoperability of green {BIM} tools, how different {BIM} authoring tools and {IEFs} can be utilized for {BPA} requires further investigation.},

The construction industry is also captivated with the idea of Industry 4.0 transformation that changes the traditional system into digital and cyber-physical system that interacts and connects across the geographical and organizational borders. However, as construction is commonly known as a low-technologically advanced industry, studies on Industry 4.0 in construction still remains elusive, as compared to other sectors such as manufacturing, electrical and electronic engineering and computer science. Therefore, this study aims to explore the current state of Industry 4.0 application from the construction engineering perspective. A systematic literature review ({SLR}) was conducted to identify publications related to Industry 4.0 in construction. A bibliometric analysis has been outlined through exclusion and inclusion principles, while a scientometric analysis has been further applied to enhance the {SLR} findings through ‘science mapping’ visualization techniques. This study presents the relevance, along with the movement, adoption and adaption of Industry 4.0 in the construction industry that further enables the spark of new ideas, in effort to realize and comprehend the current and future technological transformation in construction.},

While Industry 4.0 is expanding rapidly in manufacturing industries, its induced transformations are gradually affecting other sectors, including the construction industry. In recent years, the use of 4.0 technologies in the construction industry, termed as ‘Construction 4.0’, has increased, mostly due to the immense potential of Industry 4.0 for improving the performance of construction projects and structuring their underlying management processes. This paper proposes a classification of existing literature on applications of Construction 4.0 technologies to allow for a better analysis of trends and gaps in the research. A total of nearly 200 research papers between 2009 and 2020 were reviewed and analyzed. Overall, the analysis shows that research on Construction 4.0 is closely aligned with the construction phase. Also, the most researched topics seem to be related to the management processes of quality, risk, and health and safety.},

Interestingly, the contours of {BIM} as a scientific field are still not clearly identified. Several studies have recently tried to analyze different aspects of this issue, without providing a systematic and comprehensive methodological approach to accurately define the major themes and clusters of the {BIM} domain. This paper uses a systematic literature review approach to map the {BIM} research themes and clusters over ten years of scientific publications. 1244 articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2016 were selected and the associated metadata analyzed in order to highlight co-occurrences in author’s keywords. It appears that a few “big players” dominate the keywords, while most of the keywords used by authors are much less cited. Seven core clusters are identified using modularity optimization techniques: industry foundation classes, information technology, facility management, building, collaboration, computer aided design, and laser scanning.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) technologies enable the {AEC}-{FM} industry to create a shared virtual model of a project. {BIM} not only includes 3D geometry information but also information assigned as parameters to {BIM} elements. However, the information stored in {BIM} model elements is not comprehensive. For example, a chiller manufacturer provides a large volume of product data in pdf file format that is not included in the {BIM} model. It is possible to attach {PDF} files to {BIM} elements; the problem with an attached {PDF} is that its content cannot be interpreted by a computer. Automated retrieval and integration of distributed sources of data requires data in a machine-processable format. One way to solve this problem is to manually add additional data as element properties to a {BIM} model. However, manually inputting data to {BIM} platforms (e.g. Autodesk Revit) is a very time consuming and error-prone task. In this article, the authors present the Semantic Web technology as a new solution to integrating building product manufacturers’ data with {BIM} information. The authors convert both {BIM} data and building product data to {RDF}/{OWL} format. Data stored in {RDF}/{OWL} format can be easily processed by machines and integrated with {RDF}/{OWL} formatted data from other sources over the Internet. The authors use Semantic Web Services to handle data communication between a {BIM} knowledge base and the product manufacturers’ knowledge bases. The authors compare manual entry of manufacturer data to a {BIM} model to the semantics-based data integration presented in the paper. Results show that the authors’ approach improves productivity.},

	url = {http://www.itcon.org/paper/2019/30},
	abstract = {The management and the identification of design changes constitute an essential part of the of a design flow within the architecture, engineering and construction ({AEC}) industry, requiring the formalisation of a multi-disciplinary collaborative information modelling environment. Construction projects generate substantial amount of change information, which needs to be updated continuously throughout the process, from initial feasibility study to the decommissioning of facilities. Complications arise from the information storage in multiple incompatible file formats that can lead to the loss or omission of details.
In addition to any unexpected changes, the mismanagement of information is another factor leading to delays and costly errors. In order to mitigate such issues, this paper proposes to integrate the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) data model and Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) to validate and visually identify the result of change requests. The system is developed using C\# by 1) integrating angular framework with {ASP}.{NET} (Active Server Pages) to create a dynamic single web page and 2). Using X-{BIM} toolkit that supports {IFC} format to read, create and visualise the {BuildingSmart} Data Models (aka {IFC} Models). This approach enables a web-based platform capable of generating reports and visual previews, highlighting the differences between {IFC} files throughout the design processes.
A web-based system prototype allows users to compare subsequent versions of {IFC} design models in terms of additions, modifications and deletions. The prototype uses {NLP} to intelligently identify the changes that have been made as it compares newer and older versions of the same model, making this information available to designers and 3D modellers.
Prospective work will focus on the application of artificial intelligence ({AI}) to automate the implementation of changes within the construction models.},

	abstract = {In recent years, infrastructure restoration has been backlogged with complex factors that have captured the attention of municipal and federal authorities in North America and Europe. The subjective nature of evaluating bridge conditions and bridge deterioration is one of the main factors that influences bridge maintenance, repair, and replacement ({MR}\&R) decisions. This study presents a stochastic fuzzy logic decision support integrated with a bridge information management system ({BrIMS}) to forecast bridge deteriorations and prioritize maintenance, repair, and replacement ({MR}\&R) decisions at the conceptual design stage. The proposed system considers numerous factors that influence the prioritization of bridge {MR}\&R decision making including complex time-dependent gamma shock models. A parametric analysis is conducted in order to quantify the degree of accuracy of the system. Implementation of the system platform demonstrated the viability of integrating {BrIMS} with fuzzy-logic deterioration forecast techniques at the conceptual stage of bridge design. The proposed system is validated through a case study and found to be in agreement with actual bridge deterioration results with a percentage difference of approximately 10 - 15 \%. Besides that, the integrated platform may be utilized as a forecasting tool that is capable of predicting and prioritizing {MR}\&R decisions to components for diverse bridge design alternatives.},

Yet, a substantial number of academics and practitioners envision that the use of big data will have a significant impact on how decisions are made in the building design process, providing designers with an unprecedented amount of exceptionally detailed data on buildings and their occupants that is redefining what can be observed, modeled, simulated, predicted and measured in the industry. We first review the main concepts and technologies that shape this technological phenomenon, and then, based on the survey of around 100 cases of applications of big data and machine learning throughout all phases of building design we identify 12 clusters of applications where the technology seems to be more disruptive. The discussion then focuses on the transformative impacts of the technology on three niches where further research is more urgently needed: 1) understanding the design problem; 2) simulating and predicting the holistic performance of the design solution; 3) evaluating integrally and continuously the design product during its complete lifecycle.},

	abstract = {The activities of briefing (stating problems to be solved) and designing (instantiating solutions) are intimately interlinked – both parts of the same process to develop and procure a product which satisfies one or more needs. There is an on-going “conversation” between problem (requirement) definition and design proposal in which acceptable proposals progressively add to, and refine, the definition of the whole solution while at the same time potentially generating further problems to be resolved. At any point in time through this process, the developed whole solution is composed of partial solutions which form the context against which further problem statements are made. These problem statements are indicators for a future desired state of the whole solution. The design briefing process also can be seen as starting before professional designers are involved and continues after they complete their project contribution, so retaining design intentions alongside solutions is valuable for the on- going use of a designed product. With these ideas as background, this paper investigates the hypothesis that data for briefing and design can be usefully correlated within integrated building information data models. Several extensions are proposed to the {IFC} data schema that formalise the way requirements can be modelled. It is then shown how rule-based checking of solutions can be implemented against requirements defined in this way.},

Even the most rudimentary performance inquiries require large quantities of data regarding the properties of incorporated building materials and systems, climatic conditions, building codes, etc. Much of this data is available on the internet, yet its use is severely hampered by lack of appropriate structure and format. The {SEMERGY} research and development project was conceived with the aim of acquiring and utilizing the abundant, yet ill-structured building-related data available on the World Wide Web, through implementation of Semantic Web Technologies. This web-based data is utilized within a flexible, multi-objective design optimization environment, incorporating various performance assessment applications. The present contribution describes some of the major challenges of the project, discusses the adopted approaches, and presents {SEMERGY}'s main features.},

	abstract = {The current design of infrastructure facilities is mainly driven by the application of guidelines, codes and international standards. The complex interpretation and geometric representation of those rules impedes the dynamic search for alternative solutions. Parallel to this, in recent years there has been an increasing tendency toward the adoption of 3D modeling solutions. Of particular benefit in the design of infrastructure facilities is the use of parametric modeling systems since they allow the definition of flexible models that can easily be adapted to satisfy changes in the boundary conditions. By defining dependencies and constraints, engineers are able to capture the underlying engineering knowledge in the parametric model. However, the design knowledge that can be defined by those instruments is limited to a reduced number of constraints and simple algebraic relations among parameters that are clearly insufficient to describe the complexity of engineering rules. To close this technological gap, this paper presents a novel knowledge-based engineering ({KBE}) approach that captures the design knowledge engineers apply in the interpretation and generation of infrastructure models based on rules specific for infrastructure facilities. To achieve this, distinct knowledge units named logic models capture the generation knowledge needed to convert the abstract information engineers must deal with into a corresponding parametric geometry model. In addition, this paper presents a methodology to integrate logic models with parametric design systems. To this end, logic models are introduced as a new set of domain-specific features responsible for the generation and management of the geometry, connecting the results with other part of the model by advanced procedural geometry dependencies. Finally, the proposed methodology is verified in a real case study for a suburban railway tunnel that is in the planning stage in the city of Munich, Germany. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the proposed approach and an outlook on future developments.},

Performing building design and construction engineering raises challenges on data integration and software interoperability. Using Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) data hub to host and integrate building models is a promising solution to address those challenges, which can ease building design information management. However, the partial model query mechanism of current {BIM} data hub collaboration model has several limitations, which prevents designers and engineers to take advantage of {BIM}. To address this problem, we propose a general and effective approach to generate query code based on a Model View Definition ({MVD}).

	abstract = {This paper aims to describe rule checking method, classification and its demonstration. As applications of {BIM} extends, there have been some challenging projects on automated building compliance checking. The current rule-making method is developercentered and thus is difficult to define rules without propound programming knowledge. This paper introduces high level rule making methods with law sentence-centered approach. The proposed methods have intuitive naming convention and are directly mapped with the predicate of the law sentences. Therefore, it is easy to infer function of the methods. According to the type of object and property in instance level, three hierarchies of method classification were set: 1) level 1 divides types of instance, 2) level 2 classifies the type of property, and 3) level 3 specifies the content of checking. From the level 3, representative rule checking method is defined. The representative method is subdivided into extended methods according to the specific object and property to check. The rule checking methods are combined together to form an intermediate pseudocode. The pseudo-code is later to be parsed into computer executable form. This paper mainly focuses on 1) introducing law sentence -centered rule checking method, 2) object and property-based classification of rule checking method, 3) method extensibility and 4) demonstration of rule checking methods with actual requirement sentences from the Korea Building Permit. The high level rule checking method is developed as a part of {KBimLogic}. {KBimLogic} is a software that translates the Korea Building Permit requirement into computer executable format. {KBimLogic} is now under development with government funding.},

	title = {Integrating {BIM} and Safety: An Automated Rule-Based Checking System for Safety Planning and Simulation},
	url = {https://www.irbnet.de/daten/iconda/CIB_DC24442.pdf},
	abstract = {Safety planning in the construction industry is generally done separately from the project
execution planning. This separation creates difficulties for safety engineers to analyze
what, when, why and where safety measures are needed for preventing accidents. Lack of
information and integration of available data (safety plan, project schedule, 2D project
drawings) during the planning stage often results in scheduling work activities with
overlapping space needs that then can create hazardous conditions, for example, work
above other crew. These space requirements are time dependent and often neglected due
to the manual effort that is required to handle the data. Representation of project-specific
activity space requirements in 4D models hardly happen along with schedule and work
break-down structure. Even with full cooperation of all related stakeholders, current
safety planning and execution still largely depends on manual observation and past
experiences. The traditional manual observation is inefficient, error-prone, and the
observed result can be easily effected by subjective judgments. This paper will
demonstrate the development of an automated safety code checking tool for Building
Information Modeling ({BIM}), work breakdown structure, and project schedules in
conjunction with safety criteria to reduce the potential for accidents on construction
projects. The automated safety compliance rule checker code builds on existing
applications for building code compliance checking, structural analysis, and
constructability analysis etc. and also the advances in 4D simulations for scheduling.
Preliminary results demonstrate a computer-based automated tool can assist in safety
planning and execution of projects on a day to day basis},

	abstract = {Building codes and regulatory standards are becoming increasingly complex with the acquisition of new knowledge in the design and construction domain. The necessity for computable representation of the building codes and regulations for automating the code checking process is becoming ever more critical. Within the framework of Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) work process, model checking against building regulations is generally needed to be an automatic or semi-automatic process. These checking mechanisms generally do not modify a building design, but rather evaluates a design on the basis of the configuration of objects, their relations and attributes. This paper presents a summary of the core existing methods for computerizing building codes and standards. It reviews main concepts for these methods including knowledge representation, reasoning procedures, and knowledge acquisition. Moreover, this study evaluates the capabilities of the reviewed methods in reference to their practical applications and applied limitations for modeling computable building codes and standards. Additionally, the paper proposes methods with practical flexibility of encoding building codes knowledge domain and at the same time possess transparent and verifiable syntax and sematic features. The suggested approaches rely on evidently identifying objective and subjective data of the regulatory text before formalizing building codes. The methodology realizes the limitations of the formalization systems by clearly identifying which components of the building codes and standards can be transformed into computable model and which parts can't be encoded and requires manual compliance checking.},

	url = {https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/39482},
	abstract = {This study aims to design and implement a domain-specific computer programming language: the Building Environment Rule and Analysis ({BERA}) Language. As a result of the growing area of Building Information Modeling ({BIM}), there has been a need to develop highly customized domain-specific programming languages for handling issues in building models in the architecture, engineering and construction ({AEC}) industry. The {BERA} Language attempts to deal with building information models in an intuitive way in order to define and analyze rules in design stages. The application of the {BERA} Language aims to provide efficiency in defining, analyzing and checking rules. Specific example applications implemented in this dissertation are on the evaluation of two key aspects: building circulation and spatial programming.  
 
The objective of this study is to accomplish an effectiveness and ease of use without precise knowledge of general-purpose languages that are conventionally used in {BIM} software development. To achieve the goal, this study proposes an abstraction of the universe of discourse - it is the {BERA} Object Model ({BOM}). It is a human-centered abstraction of complex state of building models rather than the computation-oriented abstraction. By using {BOM}, users can enjoy the ease of use and portability of {BIM} data, rather than complex and platform-dependent data structures. This study also has reviewed and demonstrated its potential for extensibility of {BOM}. Not only its lateral extensions such as structural building elements, but also the vertical extensions such as additional properties for existing {BOM} objects are good examples. In current {BERA} Language Tool, many computed and derived properties/relations have been proposed and implemented, as well as some basic data directly from the given building model.  
 
Target users of the {BERA} Language are domain experts such as architects, designers, reviewers, owners, managers, students, etc., rather than {BIM} software developers. It means that the people who are interested in the building environment rule and analysis are the potential users. The {BERA} Language Tool comprises many libraries to alleviate common but unnecessary problems and limitations that are encountered when users attempt to analyze and evaluate building models using commercially available tools. Combined with other libraries which populate rich and domain-specific datasets for certain purposes, the {BERA} Language will be fairly versatile to define rules and analyze various building environmental conditions.},

The {BERA} Language, one of the domain-specific languages, deals with building information models in an intuitive way in order to ensure the quality of design and assess the design programming requirements using user-defined rules in the early design phases.

In addition, Portability of the language, extensibility and platform-dependent issues are involved in the {BERA} Language implementation.

The approach depicted in this paper enables the software developers to figure out the logical relations in order to compose {KBimCode} and its databases. {KBimCode} is a computer-readable form of Korean Building Code sentences based on a logic rule-based mechanism. Two types of relational logic definition are described in this paper. First type is a logic definition of relation between code sentences. Due to the complexity of Korean Building code structure that consists of decree, regulation or ordinance, an intensive analysis of sentence relations has been performed. Code sentences have a relation based on delegation or reference each other. Another type is a relational logic definition in a code sentence based on translated atomic sentence({TAS}) which is an explicit form of atomic sentence({AS}). The analysis has been performed because the natural language has intrinsic ambiguity which hinders interpreting embedded meaning of Building Code. Thus, both analyses have been conducted for capturing accurate meaning of building permit-related requirements as a part of the logic rule-based mechanism.},

In this study, an inventory of which regulations in the (Swedish) detailed development plans that can be automatically checked or supported by 3D visualisation was conducted. Then, two of these regulations, the building height and the building footprint area, were studied in detail to find to which extent they can be automatically checked by integration of {BIM} and geospatial data. In addition, a feasibility study of one visual criterion was conducted. One concern when automating the building permission process is the variability of content within the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) data model. Variations in modelling methods and model content leads to differences in {IFC} models\&rsquo; content and structure; these differences complicate automated processes. To facilitate automated processes, requirements on the production of {IFC} models for building permission applications could be defined in the form of model view definitions or delivery specifications.},

	abstract = {Building permit automation has become a rising international topic in the past decade due to its convenience and efficiency. Automated compliance checking saves time and resources, which is beneficial for the construction industry. Researchers have already automated parts of the building permit process and the results proved that automated building requirement compliance checking is efficient. This thesis aims to contribute by developing an algorithm to automate the checking of building placement and parking availability. The algorithm should be able to: 1) check if the house is in a buildable area, 2) examine if the house placement meets the minimum distance requirement, 3) determine parking availability with accordance to house placement. 

The algorithm in this study is developed in Feature Manipulation Engine ({FME}). Building placement automation is achieved through minimum distance logic while parking availability automation is achieved through transformations that utilize geometrical relationships. To test the algorithm, a case study is conducted for Höganäs municipality in Southern Sweden. 

In Sweden, each municipality has its own detailed development plan, which regulates the usage of land and water within its geographical boundaries. The detailed development plan also regulates building requirements. The results of the testing indicate that the developed algorithm can accurately automate building placement and parking availability according to the requirements in Höganäs municipality’s detailed development plan. The results are satisfactory, demonstrating that it is feasible to automate the checking of certain building requirements in Sweden.},

	shorttitle = {D-{COM}},
	abstract = {The concept of automated checking can bring tangible advantages including increased efficiency and
a reduction in the costs of compliance checking. The D-{COM} Research Network was formed to meet
the clear need for research and leadership in this area.
Through this initial research, {DCOM} has shown that the concerns raised in the Hackitt review of
responsibility and departures from regulations is a systemic problem. There has been a significant rise
in the formation of government expert groups to address some of these failings. {DCOM} is proposing
not simply “plugging the leaks”, but a transformation of the regulatory compliance system. Digitising
and automating this system will instil transparency and inherently build in the “Golden Thread”.
The entire lifecycle of the built environment is governed by a variety of regulations, requirements and
standards. The checking of compliance against these is a complex task, which is currently performed
manually, thus becoming highly resource intensive. Recently, the increased maturity of information
models and data and with the adoption of Building Information Modelling ({BIM}) processes, means
automation of compliance checking is becoming feasible.
Our vision follows two pathways, the first, where we determined the State of the Nation and its views
of automated compliance checking. Secondly, to engage with key stakeholders who inform and drive
regulatory policy. In following these pathways, we have started to build
• growing a community
• defining the capabilities required to deliver automated compliance checking
• developing a roadmap to deliver a working and operating model
Our work focused around three key themes. These themes were Technology, Commercial and
Political impacts on the reception of digitisation and automation of compliance checking.
This report describes the outcomes from of this work. The key output of the work is the D-{COM} 2025
roadmap. Our roadmap offers a comprehensive and methodical list of next steps. This is a plan for
the next 6 years that brings the {UK} to the verge of mass industrialisation of automated compliance
checking by 2025. Our roadmap is organised into four phases. These include a phase of research, a
pilot or proof of concept, a phase of industrialisation, where technologies developed for the pilot are
matured and designed for scalability, and finally, commercial adoption.},

To do so, we consider an {ifcOWL} ontology proposed by {buildingSMART}. The {ifcOWL} is an Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) based ontology. By combining the {ifcOWL} ontology with logical rules (expressed in Semantic Web Rule Language, {SWRL}), we demonstrate through several case studies that our approach can perform a more intuitive and flexible extraction of building views when compared to the Model View Definition ({MVD}) approach. This is because our rule-based approach dynamically creates sub-graphs (i.e. views) by specifying the {IFC} elements to extract as Globally Unique Identifiers ({GUID}), relationships or entities. Another benefit of our approach is the fact that it simplifies the maintenance and definition of building views. Once our rule-based system extracts such a building view (i.e. sub-graph), this view can be exported by using {STEP} ({STandard} for the Exchange of Product) or Turtle (a Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) syntax) formats.},

	abstract = {To date, widely implemented and full-featured query languages for building models in their native exchange formats do not exist. While interesting proposals exist for querying Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) models, their functionality is often incomplete and their semantics not precisely defined. With the introduction of the {ifcOWL} ontology as an equivalent to the {IFC} schema in the Web Ontology Language ({OWL}), an option to represent such models in {RDF} (Resource Description Framework, a general information modeling method) is provided, and such models can be queried using {SPARQL} ({SPARQL} Protocol and {RDF} Query Language). The size of data sets in complex building projects, however, renders the use of clear-text encoded {RDF} infeasible in many cases. A {SPARQL} implementation, compatible with {ifcOWL}, is proposed, directly atop a standardized binary serialization format for {IFC} building models. This novel format is the binary equivalent of traditional {IFC} serialization formats but with more compact storage and less overhead than the graph serialization in {RDF}. The format is based on {ISO} 10303-26 and relies on an open standard for organizing large amounts of data: Hierarchical Data Format version 5 ({HDF}5). Due to hierarchical partitioning and fixed-length records, only small subsets of the data are read to answer queries, improving efficiency. A prototypical implementation of the query engine is provided in the Python programming language. In several realistic use cases, the proposed system performs equivalent to or better than the state of the art in {SPARQL} querying on building models. For large datasets, the proposed storage format results in files that are 2–3 times smaller than the current, most concise, {RDF} databases while offering a platform-neutral, containerized exchange file.},

	abstract = {The exchange of construction-related data over the Web via Semantic Web Technologies is gaining interest in current research. However, most research focuses on non-geometric data, neglecting the description of geometry. While several methods to include geometry descriptions into a Semantic Web context exist, no uniform approach or general recommendation exists for the endeavour of describing building components in their entirety – including geometric descriptions –, leading to an increased suspension in applying Semantic Web Technologies in the construction domain. To therefore ease the description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits individual use cases. The identified approaches vary in their depth of the geometry description's integration into the Semantic Web and are subsequently studied regarding their overall aptness and characteristics in consideration of their application for future industry and research projects. In respect of the ongoing research in the field of the application of Semantic Web Technologies, not only in the construction domain, this article poses as an important foundation by giving a clear overview of existing implementations and relevant open research questions. Having this overview, the suspense for adapting to Semantic Web methods for describing geometries can be overcome by users more easily, while software developers can start to connect their clients' use cases to suitable approaches and related implementations to represent geometry in a Semantic Web context.},

Although {BIM} focuses on processes throughout the lifecycle of the built environment, the applications in the planning phase, e.g. the generation of construction site layouts, have not reached their full potential yet. One important example herein is the allocation and dimensioning of resources (e.g., building materials and equipment) which is typically carried out by humans according to clearly defined rules and best practices. This paper presents model-based rule checking for the planning of construction site layouts. We demonstrate that existing Business Rule Management Systems ({BRMS}), such as the open-source rule engine Drools, can be used. We combine Drools with the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) to retrieve data from a building information model and use the information within the rule engine. We define general model requirements and implement a sample set of prototype rules. We also introduce the concept of offset geometry for rules that, for example, demand a known safety distance between temporary construction site elements. The developed approaches are explained and evaluated in field-realistic, practical case studies. Finally, we present a discussion how the application of the developed rule-based system may assist human decision making in tasks such as safe construction sites layout planning.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) is becoming an integral part of the design, architecture, and construction process, as it can integrate all building data in an accessible digital representation that can be viewed in a 3D environment prior to construction. This supports the capability of evaluating a model against building codes or design rules to ensure that the building meets the relevant functional and safety requirements for occupants. However, building regulations are typically represented in natural language and, to date, they have not been created with regard to the digital {BIM} design process. To automate the design evaluation of a building model, this paper describes a simple, yet extendable, domain-specific language for computationally representing building interior design rules and a method for evaluating rules in this language against a {BIM} model. Furthermore, previous language-based model-checking approaches have not explored the applicability of their proposed languages beyond model-design evaluation. This paper demonstrates the use of our language in a second, more complex, use case, namely the automated generation of multiple valid alternative model interior designs, compliant to a set of design rules expressed in our language. We have evaluated the usefulness of our language in two generative-design case studies, namely kitchen layouts using a set of real-world kitchen design rules provided by an commercial partner, and living-room layouts using rules put forward in earlier automated-design research. Therefore, this research bridges the concepts of automated model checking and generative design relying on the same rule language.},

	abstract = {Building codes are the rules and guidelines that specify the minimum acceptable level of safety, accessibility, general welfare, etc. of building models. Code compliance checking of building models requires precise identification or estimation of the real-world geographic location of {IFC} objects. Geolocation based on Bounding Boxes is a very simple technique defined by minimum and maximum longitudes and latitudes. In this paper, we discuss that bounding box technique cannot help precise identification of {IFC} objects and does not fulfill all our requirements of code compliance checking. Therefore, we have to go beyond bounding boxes and analyze Well-known Text format for the precise identification of data objects in the building model. Well-Known Text is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map and offers a precise and compact machine and human-readable representation of geometric objects. We explored two geospatial tools (Stardog and {GraphDB}) for working with Well-known Text and illustrate various examples narrating their similarities and differences on various test cases. Both the tools implement several extensions to ease queries for processing geospatial data. These Geo-{SPARQL} extentions are designed to accommodate systems based on qualitative spatial reasoning and systems based on quantitative spatial computations.},

Using linked data-based crowdsourcing techniques for interpretation of building performance patterns enables the creation of knowledge graphs of building data, enriched with contextualized building performance insights. This paper presents a crowdsourcing mechanism that allows the semantic enrichment of building performance patterns through semantic annotation and classification.

Such a semantic rule-checking process would be of considerable value to regulation compliance checking procedures, because the additional logical basis would (1) allow consistency checking of the rules in the regulations (and thus a better management of the rules), (2) allow a faster, more transparent and more reliable implementation of regulation compliance checking procedures (rules are human-readable and more easily changeable), and (3) provide the option to rely on available reasoning engines and generate proofs without any additional implementation effort. Obviously, there are a number of strategies and approaches that can be followed regarding the realisation of such a rule-checking process. In this article, we will outline a number of rule-checking approaches that have been reported for semantic rule-checking in the {AEC} domain, including rule-based checking algorithms implemented on {BIM} platforms as plug-ins, Semantic Web Rule Language ({SWRL}) rule based checking relying on an external rule engine, and N3Logic-based rule checking using a backward-chaining procedure. For every approach, a number of implementation procedures will be considered. This will result in a comprehensive strategic overview at the end of the paper, which can be used as a guide for parties interested in implementing a semantic rule-checking process for regulation compliance checking.},

	abstract = {Building related data tends to be generated, used and retained in a domain-specific manner. The lack of interoperability between data domains in the architecture, engineering and construction ({AEC}) industry inhibits the cross-domain use of data at an enterprise level. Semantic web technologies provide a possible solution to some of the noted interoperability issues. Traditional methods of information capture fail to take into account the wealth of soft information available throughout a building. Several sources of information are not included in performance assessment frameworks, including social media, occupant communication, mobile communication devices, occupancy patterns, human resource allocations and financial information. The paper suggests that improved data interoperability can aid the integration of untapped silos of information into existing structured performance measurement frameworks, leading to greater awareness of stakeholder concerns and building performance. An initial study of how building-related data can be published following semantic web principles and integrated with other ‘soft-data’ sources in a cross-domain manner is presented. The paper goes on to illustrate how data sources from outside the building operation domain can be used to supplement existing sources. Future work will include the creation of a semantic web based performance framework platform for building performance optimisation.},

Despite technological advancements of information and knowledge management in the building and construction industry, a link between safety management and information models is still missing. The objective of this study is to investigate a new approach to organize, store and re-use construction safety knowledge. A construction safety ontology is proposed to formalize the safety management knowledge. It consists of three main domain ontology models, including Construction Product Model, Construction Process Model, and Construction Safety Model. One-on-one expert interviews were conducted for ontology evaluation. The interaction between safety ontology and Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) is also explored. A prototype application of ontology-based job hazard analysis ({JHA}) and visualization is implemented to further illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed ontology. The developed construction safety ontology enables more effective inquiry of safety knowledge, which is the first step towards automated safety planning for {JHA} using {BIM}.},

We divide the functional architecture of a building energy management system into three interconnected modules that include building management system ({BMS}), benchmarking ({BMK}), and evaluation \&amp; control ({ENC}) modules. The {BMS} module is responsible for measuring several useful environmental parameters, as well as real-time energy consumption of the building. The {BMK} module provides the necessary information required to understand the context and cause of building energy efficiency or inefficiency, and also the information which can further differentiate normal and abnormal energy consumption in different scenarios. The {ENC} module evaluates all the information coming from {BMS} and {BMK} modules, the information is contextualized, and finally the cause of energy inefficiency/abnormality and mitigating control actions are determined. Methodology to design appropriate ontology and inference rules for various modules is also discussed. With the help of actual data obtained from three different rooms in a commercial building in Singapore, a case study is developed to demonstrate the application and advantages of the proposed framework. By mitigating the appropriate cause of abnormal inefficiency, we can achieve 5.7\%, 11.8\% and 8.7\% energy savings in Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3 respectively, while creating minimum inconvenience for the users.},

	abstract = {Fire safety regulations impose very strict requirements on building design, especially for buildings built with combustible materials. It is believed that it is possible to improve the management of these regulations with a better integration of fire protection aspects in the building information modeling ({BIM}) approach. A new {BIM}-based domain is emerging, the automated code checking, with its growing number of dedicated approaches. However, only very few of these works have been dedicated to managing the compliance to fire safety regulations in timber buildings. In this paper, the applicability to fire safety in the Canadian context is studied by constituting and executing a complete method from the regulations text through code-checking construction to result analysis. A design science approach is used to propose a code-checking method with a detailed analysis of the National Building Code of Canada ({NBCC}) in order to obtain the required information. The method starts by retrieving information from the regulation text, leading to a compliance check of an architectural building model. Then, the method is tested on a set of fire safety regulations and validated on a building model from a real project. The selected fire safety rules set a solid basis for further development of checking rules for the field of fire safety. This study shows that the main challenges for rule checking are the modeling standards and the elements’ required levels of detail. The implementation of the method was successful for geometrical as well as non-geometrical requirements, although further work is needed for more advanced geometrical studies, such as sprinkler or fire dampers positioning.},

	abstract = {Manually checking models for compliance against building regulation is a time-consuming task for architects and construction engineers. There is thus a need for algorithms that process information from construction projects and report non-compliant elements. Still automated code-compliance checking raises several obstacles. Building regulations are usually published as human readable texts and their content is often ambiguous or incomplete. Also, the vocabulary used for expressing such regulations is very different from the vocabularies used to express Building Information Models ({BIM}). Furthermore, the high level of details associated to {BIM}-contained geometries induces complex calculations. Finally, the level of complexity of the {IFC} standard also hinders the automation of {IFC} processing tasks. Model chart, formal rules and pre-processors approach allows translating construction regulations into semantic queries. We further demonstrate the usefulness of this approach through several use cases. We argue our approach is a step forward in bridging the gap between regulation texts and automated checking algorithms. Finally with the recent building ontology {BOT} recommended by the W3C Linked Building Data Community Group, we identify perspectives for standardizing and extending our approach.},

This is a major task for both designers and enforcers, often leading to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. Technical developments in Building Information Modelling ({BIM}) offer the potential for a new generation of software tools that can automate the checking of compliance with building codes, thus improving the efficiency of building design and procurement. To attain these efficiencies designers must change their working practices and move away from the definition of a building in multiple and disparate documents to a single coherent building model from which the documentation is generated. Theoretically, this building model could contain sufficient information to respond to interrogation at the level of building code compliance, though in practice only a percentage of the required information is normally present. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance, identifies the key issues for future development and examines the causes of information paucity for compliance checking in the current generation of {BIM} tools.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modelling ({BIM})-based model checking is maybe the best way to utilize {BIM} technology and to contribute to the development of new procedures in the architecture, engineering, and construction ({AEC}) industry by enabling reuse of knowledge ({McHill}, 2012). This research seeks to increase the utilisation of {BIM}-based model checking ({BMC}) solutions in general, and automated checking of regulations in particular, thereby exploring and suggesting a range of theoretical and practical methods for transforming regulations into applicable digital rules. Regulations include acts and codes with related guidelines and standards.  
The target group for use of the developed methods are developers of computable rule specifications – applicable for implementation in applications to be used by the entire construction industry. The specification of the computable rules will then be programmed into software and implemented as new processes for quality assessment of designed solutions or compliance checking.  
There has been limited research attention to methods for transforming written building regulations on a large scale into computable rules for {BMC} that can be specified in an efficient way. This research intends to establish a foundation for the first stage in the development of applicable rules in {BMC} which can be adapted for use with the major part of the requirements in the regulations which are applicable for digitalisation. Reduction of complexity has been a major guiding star in both the research approach and the development of methods.  
The background for this research is deeply rooted in the needs of the {AEC} industry (architects, engineers, contractors). {BMC} rules are today mostly focused on clash detection by use of simple geometry-based logic for the conjunction of different parts of building elements like beams and ducts. Free space for a turning circle is another example of a rule based on detection of geometrical conjunction. This type of model-checking replaces visual inspection and the need for information and interpretation is limited. Support of {BMC} in knowledge-based domains like compliance checking regulations, or compliance with specifications in contracts, is so far limited but is expected to be the new area in {BMC}. Today’s challenge is therefore to express the regulations in a way that enables valid interpretations of computable rules in {BMC}.},

	abstract = {The ingredients for an effective automated audit of a building design include a {BIM} model containing the design information, an electronic regulatory knowledge model, and a practical method of processing these computerised representations. There have been numerous approaches to computer-aided compliance audit in the {AEC}/{FM} domain over the last four decades, but none has yet evolved into a practical solution. One reason is that they have all been isolated attempts that lack any form of standardisation. The current research project therefore focuses on using an open standard regulatory knowledge and {BIM} representations in conjunction with open standard executable compliant design workflows to automate the compliance audit process. This paper provides an overview of different approaches to access information from a regulatory model representation. The paper then describes the use of a purpose-built high-level domain specific query language to extract regulatory information as part of the effort to automate manual design procedures for compliance audit.},

	abstract = {Two common challenges in the computer-aided compliance audit of building engineering designs are addressed in the current research. The first is to ensure that any form of computable representation is practical and relatively easy to use and maintain. The second is to ensure that performance-based regulatory compliance criteria, which are often qualitative in nature, are adequately addressed and correctly represented. This research proposes a method of automating manual compliant design procedures using an open standard executable workflow representation that can be specified and maintained relatively easily by a design engineer. This executable workflow is referred to as the compliant design procedure ({CDP}) and can be described graphically. When executed in a computing environment, a {CDP} can guide the compliance audit process by checking a given design represented in a model view or subset of the building information model ({BIM}), referred to as the building compliance model ({BCM}), against the criteria in a digital building code, referred to as the regulatory knowledge model ({RKM}), which is developed specifically for this purpose. This paper describes the process of modeling and encoding {BCM}, {CDP}, and {RKM}, which are independent input components of the proposed compliance audit system framework. Supplementary human input and the ability to exchange input and output data with external simulation tools to solve some of the more complex qualitative criteria are important features of the framework.},

	abstract = {The main challenges in automating the regulatory compliance checking of building engineering designs are the availability of computable representations of the building and the regulatory knowledge, as well as a system that can process and manage these representations effectively. The emergence of Building Information Modelling ({BIM}) and Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) at the start of the millennium has sparked useful research in the area of sharing building information effectively; but, challenges remain with producing a practical and manageable regulatory knowledge representation that can be processed effectively by a compliance checking system. Research is being conducted to develop a two-part regulatory knowledge representation which can be maintained independently by designers and regulators. One part is a set of compliant design procedures modelled as Business Process Diagrams ({BPD}) using an open standard Business Process Model and Notation ({BPMN}). The other part is the associated regulatory constraints and rules encoded in a computable format suitable for execution with the {BPMN}. This paper reports on a set of guidelines developed for the purposes of encoding regulatory knowledge into the proposed computable representation. A verification method (C/{VM}2) prescribed by the New Zealand Building Code ({NZBC}) for the performance-based design of buildings related to fire safety has been selected as a case study to illustrate the encoding process. These guidelines are adaptable for encoding the entire {NZBC}.},

	abstract = {Legal text is typically conveyed in natural language and thus not readily suitable for computer processing. Numerous work-around approaches have been proposed by researchers in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management ({AEC}/{FM}) domain over the last four decades to create computable representations of normative data that can be used to automate some of the processes in the domain. The transition from human-readable text to a structured representation can occur in many possible ways, eg through Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) techniques, manual annotations, or through direct coding. In all cases, however, the human-readable document at the source remains the sole point of reference. Ideally, however, one digital structured representation should also be available and recognised as the single digital point of reference. Research in the {AEC}/{FM} domain has shown that automated compliant building design processes would benefit from a single standardised and manageable digital representation of normative data. Recent efforts in the legal domain have shown promising developments in legal mark-up languages such as {LegalDocML} and {LegalRuleML} as emerging open standards for legal knowledge interchange. In this article, we explore the potential of adapting these emerging standards to accommodate specific requirements of the {AEC}/{FM} domain.},

This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based {NLP} approach for automated {IE} from construction regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based {IE} rules and conflict resolution ({CR}) rules in {IE}. A variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the {IE} and {CR} rules. Phrase structure grammar ({PSG})-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed {IE} algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively.},

	abstract = {One of the major goals of building information modeling is to support automated compliance checking ({ACC}). To support {ACC}, building design information needs to be extracted from building information models ({BIMs}) and transformed into a representation that would allow for automated reasoning about those design information in combination with information from regulatory documents. However, existing {BIM} information extraction ({IE}) efforts are limited in supporting complete automation of {ACC}. Complete automation of {ACC} requires (1) automating both the extraction of information from {BIMs} and the extraction of regulatory information from regulatory documents and (2) aligning the instances of information concepts and relations extracted from a {BIM} with those extracted from regulatory documents, in order to facilitate direct automated reasoning about both information for compliance assessment. To address this gap, this paper proposes an automated {BIM} {IE} method for extracting design information from industry foundation classes ({IFC})-based {BIMs} into a semantic logic-based representation that is aligned with a matching semantic logic-based representation of regulatory information. The proposed {BIM} {IE} method utilizes semantic natural language processing ({NLP}) techniques and java standard data access interface ({JSDAI}) techniques to automatically extract project information from {IFC}-based {BIMs} and transform it into a logic format (logic facts) that is ready to be automatically checked against logic-represented regulatory rules (logic rules). The {BIM} {IE} method was tested on extracting design information from a Duplex Apartment {BIM} model. Compared to a manually developed gold standard, the testing results showed 100\% precision and a short time of 15.02 seconds for processing 38,898 lines of data.},

It focuses on {RFPs} for large public buildings (over 5million dollars) in South Korea, which generally entail complex designs. A total of 27 {RFPs} for housing, office, exhibition, hospital, sports center, and courthouse projects were analyzed to develop computer-interpreted {RFP} rules. Each {RFP} was composed of over 1800 sentences. Of these, only three to 366 sentences could be translated into a computer-interpretable sentence. For further analysis, this study deployed context-free grammar ({CFG}) in natural language processing, and classified morphemes into four categories: i.e., object (noun), method (verb), strictness (modal), and others. The subcategorized morphemes included three types of objects, twenty-nine types of methods, and five levels of strictness. The coverage applicability of the derived objects and methods was checked and validated against three additional {RFP} cases and then through a test case using a newly developed model checker system. The findings are expected to be useful as a guideline and basic data for system developers in the development of a generalized automated design checking system for South Korea.},

A {BIM}-based framework for the development of components that deliver Automatic Code Compliance ({ACC}) is presented. The structural design problems that such components solve are categorised as simple, where {ACC} can be implemented directly, or complex, where more advanced approaches are needed. The mathematical process of Multi-Dimensional Data Fitting ({MDDF}) is introduced in order for the latter, enabling the compression of complex engineering calculations to a single equation that can be easily implemented into a {BIM} software engineering package. Proof-of-concept examples are given for both cases: offsite-manufactured structural joists are utilised as a non-recursive example, implementing the results obtained in the manufacturer’s literature; the axial capacity of metal fasteners in axially loaded timber-to-timber connections are utilised as an example of recursive problems. The {MDDF} analysis and its implementation in a {BIM} package of those problems are presented. Finally, the concept is generalised for non-structural aspects at a framework level, and the challenges, implications, and prospects of {ACC} in a {BIM} context are discussed.},

By comparing design alternatives for an actual building model, this paper also demonstrates building circulation and its associated properties of numeric data. The conventional software-driven approaches have intrinsic limitations that include limited interfaces, restricted parameters, closed rules except pre-defined rules, etc. A script language-based approach, however, is strongly necessary for various and flexible design review tasks especially for retrieving and computing specific dataset. This paper specifically demonstrates actual design review tasks as follows: 1) comparison and visualization of the differences between design alternatives in terms of their different spatial allocations; 2) analyzing numeric data result, {NDBC} (Numeric Data of Building Circulation), for evaluation of building circulation factors in each department of building; and as a result, 3) overall quantitative analysis and its result will be reported on given actual {BIM} models in order to support design decision making among various spatial allocation scenarios. For the actual demonstration presented in this paper, we modified some part of {BERA} language applications and defined appropriate {BERA} program code and Java code that are executable on given {BIM} models.},

	volume = {18},
	url = {http://itcon.org/paper/2013/2},
	abstract = {The notion of advancing levels of adequate regulatory compliance within the domain of construction and engineering is by no means a new phenomenon. An extensive degree of effort has over a number of decades previously focused on semi/fully automating design checking against regulatory building codes. After experiencing somewhat of a dip in popularity within academia, this research topic is once again of great interest due to the on-going adoption of Building Information Modelling ({BIM}) within the construction domain among other drivers like frequent updates to building regulatory documents particularly in relation to sustainability related issues like energy efficiency of buildings. This interest will only increase as we witness further widespread adoption of this new {BIM} paradigm across until now untouched disciplines. Unfortunately design checking within the remit of {BIM} still faces major problems with respect to national and local regulations as no sustainably sensible or scalable method has yet been implemented to ensure compliance rules are consistent with current legislation within these contexts. This work questions a suitable representational data format for {UK} construction and engineering regulations focusing on machine processable formats built entirely on open data standards which can then set the basis for addressing the aforementioned issues. We compare two existing legislation data models, namely the Crown Legislation Markup Language ({CLML}) and Akoma Ntoso, whilst in the process grading each on its suitability for most accurately accommodating and expressing the domain and profession specific nature of typical building regulations. The study conclusions indicate that the design, management and current availability of the {CLML} has resulted in a scenario where barriers exist to widespread adoption, this includes building out community in support of the language. Akoma Ntoso on the other hand has focused on building community around the proposed standard. This increases the likelihood of phased organisational transition towards the standard for achieving improved representational data modelling.},

The scope, level of detail, and time resolution of the 3D visualization process are determined based on the targeted audiences. Developing the 3D visualization requires obtaining and merging heterogeneous data from different sources (such as {BIM} model and {CPM} schedule). The data merging process is usually carried out on ad hoc basis for a specific visualization case which limits the reusability of the process. This paper discusses a framework for automatic merging of heterogeneous data to create a visualization. The paper describes developing an ontology which captures concepts related to the visualization process. Then, heterogeneous data sources that are commonly used in construction are fed into the ontology which can be queried to produce different visualization scenarios. The potential of this approach has been demonstrated by providing multiple visualization scenarios that cover different audiences, levels of detail, and time resolutions.},

The review outlines a description of the situation in the form of descriptions of process mapping and process completion practices, as well as data flow mapping and conceptual data view. The existing problems, good practices, and suggestions by users are described to improve the procedures of the Register of Buildings as a tool or the services of procedures supported by it, which is advisable to take into account by the register’s owner in the organization of further developments. The second chapter of the report describes the vision of what kind of tool could be the procedural system of the Register of Buildings be in the future. The vision for the future describes the steps to be digitalized, including an alternative process flow as an innovation for applying for notifications and permits using an information model that would allow faster course of the process. In addition, future vision processes, data flows, and conceptual data views are described. As an addition, complementing requirements for the product development have been described which further convey the requirements that have become apparent during the work, the conveying of which was not practical with the final prototype or the aforementioned descriptions. In order to simplify future procedures, checklists were prepared for the case handlers in cooperation with the competent authorities, which is an internal tool for the Register of Buildings in carrying out future procedures. The suggested practices and measures that the case handlers could apply to carry out procedures to ensure a more efficient procedure were also described.
The third chapter of the report carries out an impact analysis as a qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the impact of the implementation of the future vision (including the new {EHR} user interface, new processes, and compliance with best practices described) on the case handlers and other competent authorities.
The analysis found that, if the procedural volumes of the year 2018 are taken as the basis, the implementation of the future vision saves working time for the competent authorities in the amount of at least 45 {FTEs} per calendar year.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a proposal for a national building standard in Sweden. We define requirements for the proposed standard, e.g., it should support development of 3D city models, connect to building information models ({BIM}) and national registers and be based on a national classification system for the urban environment. Based on these requirements we develop an Application Domain Extension ({ADE}) of the building model in the proposed {CityGML} 3.0 standard denoted {CityGML} Sve-Test. {CityGML} 3.0 includes several new features of interest, e.g., the space concept, enhanced possibilities to convert data, and to link to other standards. In our study we create test data according to {CityGML} Sve-Test and evaluate it against the requirements. It is shown that {BIM} models (in Industry Foundation Classes, {IFC}, format) can be converted to {CityGML} Sve-Test and that a classification system facilitates this conversion. The {CityGML} Sve-Test dataset can be used to increase the automation level in building permissions checking and a related study shows that {CityGML} 3.0 has capabilities to link to legal information and be a base for 3D cadastral index maps. Based on our experience, we suggest that the national building standard should conform to international standards and, if possible, include a classification system. The exchange format ({GML}, {JSON} etc.) might change, but to be based on a standardized data model ensures harmonized structures and concepts.},

	abstract = {In both the Geo and {BIM} domains, it is widely acknowledged that the integration of geo-data and {BIM}-data is beneficial and a crucial step in facing the multi-disciplinary challenges of our built environment. The result of this integration – broadly termed as {GeoBIM} – has a range of potential uses from district study to road safety. However, from the data perspective, this integration raises the question of how to integrate very detailed design and construction data from the {BIM} domain with contextual geospatial data (both 2D and 3D) that model a very diverse range of aspects of the wider built and natural environment.
This paper reports work carried out during the second phase of the {EuroSDR} {GeoBIM} project, which sets out to understand the general status of {GeoBIM} across Europe with particular focus from a National Mapping and Cadastral Agency perspective. The first phase of the project reviewed the current status of {GeoBIM} in participating countries and identified the need for specific detailed use cases to overcome both the lack of awareness and the lack of understanding of the potential of {GeoBIM}. We present both an update on the current status of {GeoBIM}, and additional details of one of the selected use cases relating to planning/development permits. For the latter, we have been able to develop a detailed workflow highlighting specific data exchange points within the process to issue a development permit, allowing a more in-depth identification of both the roles and data needs at each stage.},

	abstract = {The current three-dimensionally (3D) delimited property units are in most countries registered using two-dimensional (2D) documentation and textual descriptions. This approach has limitations if used for representing the actual extent of complicated 3D property units, in particular in city centers. 3D digital models such as building information model ({BIM}) and 3D geographic information system ({GIS}) could be utilized for accurate identification of property units, better representation of cadastral boundaries, and detailed visualization of complex buildings. To facilitate this, several requirements need to be identified considering organizational, legal, and technical aspects. In this study, we formulate these requirements and then develop a framework for integration of 3D cadastre and 3D digital models. The aim of this paper is that cadastral information stored based on the land administration domain model ({LADM}) are integrated with {BIM} on building level for accurate representation of legal boundaries and with {GIS} on city level for visualization of 3D cadastre in urban environments. The framework is implemented and evaluated against the requirements in a practical case study in Sweden. The conclusion is that the integration of the cadastral information and {BIM}/{GIS} is possible on both conceptual level and data level which will facilitate that organizations dealing with cadastral information (cadastral units), {BIM} models (architecture, engineering, and construction companies), and {GIS} (surveying units on e.g., municipality level) can exchange information; this facilitates better representation and visualization of 3D cadastral boundaries.},

However, there are a lot of problems related to the development of a legality system due to the complexity of Korean regulations, relationships and structures, the inefficiency of designing a legality system based on 2D drawings, the duplication examinations of documents (soliciting forms for civil affairs), and the drawings themselves. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a legality system for building administration permission services based on open Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) in Korea. To achieve this purpose, the authors investigate the permission procedures and regulation structures used in current building administration permissions, then formulate an ideal permission procedure and regulation structure for the legality system in Korea. In addition, the authors investigate element technologies (for example, methods of structuring regulation, {BIM} model checker, {BIM} model viewer) for a legality system based on {BIM} and develop a prototypical legality checking software. Finally, the authors suggest strategies and future applications for a legality system based on {BIM}.},

	abstract = {A smart built environment has become necessary for ensuring social well-being due to uncontrolled population growth and unrestrainable urban sprawl. In this connection, effective land administration is a significant element to actualize sustainable development. Yet existing building permit procedures fail to satisfy the need for current construction demands because of the insufficient transparency and inefficient procedures. Two dimensional (2D) based systems also remain incapable to unambiguously delineate the property ownership related to complex buildings. Keeping up-to-date the three dimensional (3D) urban models is another key for smart cities but this issue has become difficult owing to the rapid changes in the cities. In this sense, this paper first examines thoroughly the current situation in Turkey in terms of the building permit procedures, land administration, and 3D city modeling. Then, the paper detailedly proposes a reformative framework. The framework consists of the use of digital building models for both building permit processes and 3D registration of property ownership, as well as updating the 3D city model databases. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of its applicability with a discussion of the prospective directions.},

The new model combines the semantic modeling approach of the {SMARTcodes} project with the theoretical foundations established by Nyman and Fenves, namely the four level representation. This hybrid model organizes the representation in four levels and allows for separate modeling of domain concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules, and the overall organization of the building code. The model is evaluated with a case study. The İzmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code is chosen as it is representative of complex building codes that are in effect throughout Turkey. The formalizable rules in the section of Izmir code that apply to all types of buildings, are represented in computer implementable format based on the new model. The research presented in this paper shows that decomposing a building code into four levels and modeling rules based on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective modeling strategy for representing building codes in a computable form.},

	title = {Computer representation of building codes for automated compliance checking ({PhD})},
	abstract = {This dissertation constitutes a study in the field of automated compliance checking, with a concentration on building code representations. Development of compliance checking systems has been an area of research that aims to provide computational support for accurate compliance checking of building projects against applicable building codes in a time and cost effective way. Systems for compliance checking of building projects require appropriate representations for building codes. Building codes are complex documents written in natural languages, and the development of computable representations is challenging.
This dissertation proposes and demonstrates a new representation model and an accompanying modeling methodology for representing building codes in computable form that can be utilized in the development of automated compliance checking systems. The model adopts the four level representation paradigm as a theoretical base and uses the semantic modeling approach for developing the building code representation. The model breaks down the representation into four levels which allows separate modeling of domain concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules, and the organization of the building code.
The dissertation shows that decomposing a building code into four levels and modeling rules based on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective modeling strategy for representing building codes in a computable form that is independent of automated compliance checking systems. The applicability of the model has been evaluated through a case study. The case study successfully illustrates the modeling of building codes that constitute parts of İzmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code, as well as a prototype implementation of an automated checking system utilizing this building code representation.},

Diverse approaches have already been presented for addressing this challenge. This article will look into the possibility of addressing the interoperability challenge in the building life-cycle with a linked data approach. An outline is given of how linked data technologies tend to be deployed, thereby working towards a “more holistic” perspective on the building, or towards a large-scale web of “linked building data”. From this overview, and the associated use case scenarios, we conclude that the interoperability challenge cannot be “solved” using linked data technologies, but that it can be addressed. In other words, information exchange and management can be improved, but a pragmatic usage of technologies is still required in practice. Finally, we give an initial outline of some anticipated use cases in the building life-cycle in which the usage of linked data technologies may generate advantages over existing technologies and methods.},

The information required for monitoring and checking is obtained from different data sources in different information systems. In this context, information sharing between stakeholders and the semantic interoperability that prevails with varying information systems are necessary. However, the implementation of information sharing and semantic interoperability can be a challenge. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling ({BIM}) environment among different information systems. The framework integrates building information from {BIM}, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from {BIM} and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The regulation clauses are transformed into {SPARQL} ({SPARQL} Protocol and {RDF} Query Language) rules. A case study is performed to apply the framework, and environmental monitoring and automated compliance checking are implemented in the context of a real distributed energy station project. The testing results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Safety checking which identifies hazards before they occur is a core process of safety management on construction sites. However, the traditional construction safety checking which is operated by the experienced manager is manual and time-consuming. In order to integrate new technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for construction safety checking i.e. {CSCOntology} (Construction Safety Checking Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using an ontology language, {OWL} for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation provisions are represented with a rule language, {SWRL}. Then the construction safety checking processes are implemented in the {JESS}, a rule engine for the Java platform by transforming {OWL} knowledge into {JESS} facts, and {SWRL} constraints into {JESS} rules. A real-world example has been demonstrated in Protégé 3.4 beta to show the proposed safety checking process, according to the regulation examples taken from “29 {CFR} 1926 {OSHA} Construction Industry Regulations”.},

	abstract = {The use of {IFC} as a standard format in exchange processes has been increasing as the industry begins to address the need of interoperability. A current problem with the use of {IFC} is in the quality of product models. Much effort has addressed this issue in the form of certifications to ensure a minimum quality of exchange requirements for an {IFC} file. However, even with the recent increasing awareness and effort to improve the quality of {IFC} files, the process is still too tedious, time consuming and requires manual efforts by experts. Even if those resources are available, there is currently no clear and quantifiable definitions of what exactly is a good quality {IFC} file. Without such measures, the adoption of {IFC} as standard exchange format will be hindered and the industry will be left with only restricted alternatives that are mostly vendor dependent. This paper sets out to address this issue in two aspects: first by defining what a good quality {IFC} model is, and second by proposing rules that can be automated to measure with confidence the completeness and correctness of the {IFC} model. These two aspects will serve as a starting point toward a more comprehensive and quantifiable measures of the quality of an {IFC} file. This proposed goal is represented by using well defined and well documented rules collected from various projects the authors had experienced over the years. The rules include all known aspects of {IFC}, including geometry, which currently requires mostly manual validation. The paper also proposes a method to address import validation that is under-developed compared to the export validation.},

	abstract = {Computer-aided compliance checking is always a challenge in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction ({AEC}) domain. In recent years, semantic compliance checking has gained a lot of attention. As the critical ingredient of the checking system, rule information needs to be extracted from regulatory texts and be formalized into machine-readable format. This paper proposed a semantic frame-based information extraction method with a focus on domain semantics and lexical semantics.

	abstract = {We present a methodology and prototype software framework to formalise normative provisions related to building design and construction to support automated compliance audit processes of {ISO}-standard building information models ({BIM}). Our framework is based on the declarative Answer Set Programming ({ASP}) logic programming language that we extend to support optimised geometric and spatial reasoning. We address three key challenges in formalising building codes: (1) Ambiguity and qualitative aspects of modern performance-based building codes, e.g. "Essential information on wayfinding must be easy to see, read and understand ({BR}15)"; "There shall be no direct line of sight between an access route and a {WC} ({NZBC}-G1)". Our framework supports integrated layers of abstraction (in the context of ontologies and knowledge engineering) in order to ground how behavioural and human-centred terms such as "easy to see" and "access route" are ultimately defined based on results from cognitive psychology and declarative spatial reasoning. (2) Managing a relatively large code base that can support maintainability, extensibility, traceability, and transparency, i.e. a particular code definition can be easily traced back to research literature used for its formalisation, and indeed multiple alternative definitions can be implemented and checked simultaneously. (3) Keeping the computational runtime efficient for practical applications, despite processing a large number of codes and a large size of real-world building models. We present empirical results (including real building models from New Zealand) to demonstrate that formalised codes definitions can focus exclusively on the semantics without mixing in "tricks" to make them computationally faster for handling a large-scale {BIM}, which is often at the cost of clarity and code base maintainability, etc. Thus, we leverage the declarative character of {ASP} to achieve a total separation of (a) semantic definition from (b) computational runtime efficiency of conformance checking.},

A one-to-one mapping between a {BIM} software tool's native data format and the {IFC} data exchange standard is not possible. This complexity makes it difficult for the translator modules in a {BIM} software tool to accurately map the {IFC} elements, causing interoperability problems while exchanging {BIM} data using {IFC}. Also, there are mistakes made by the software developers in implementing the mapping to and from {IFC} data exchange standard, which adds to the issue. A proposed approach to tackle the interoperability problem is to adopt a 'divide and conquer' method by classifying {IFC} entities as per their relative importance for a discipline and to rectify the interoperability issues of the most important entities first. This paper proposes a framework to classify the {IFC} entities as per their relative importance with respect to various disciplines and introduce an index called {RI} (Relative Importance). This paper also suggests the application of the proposed framework in the interoperability measurement (conformance testing) implementation for {BIM} software tools, and in presenting the results of conformance tests.},

This paper reviews various language-based rule checking systems that have been proposed and assesses their potentials and gaps that need to be overcome for them to become practical. It introduces metrics of eleven criteria to analyze various approaches to assess their readiness for the real-world implementations. The criteria cover a wide range of aspects including language
expressiveness, ease of use to define a rule, openness, level of maturity, and performance. These criteria help to identify gaps that currently exist that need to be overcome to allow a leap from a proof-of-concept to the real-world implementation. From the assessment, it is obvious that no one single approach is currently capable of covering the entire spectrum of requirements for automated rule-checking systems. The assessment also shows that the possibilities of combining two or more approaches may accelerate the realization of an open and practical language-driven automated rule checking system},

technology can be applied in two different ways. First, we can check the consistency of the spatial constraints

crete building design is compliant with these constraints. The paper gives a detailed overview on the currently

However, to make decisions within complex urban planning and engineering tasks these two domains and their data models must be combinded. Currently, the necessary joint information is created by converting data between the two domains. Because the employed modelling differs conceptually, there is a high risk of information loss durring these conversions. To overcome this issue, we present a spatio-semantic query language that allows analysis of {IFC} building information models and geospatial {CityGML} models in an integrated context. Rather than converting between {IFC} and {CityGML}, a holistic information space is realized by an intermediate layer that abstracts from the two schemas of spatio-semantic modelling.},

	abstract = {One of the characteristic features of object-based Building Information Models is the close integration of geometric and semantic information into one model. This concept is thoroughly implemented by the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}), a comprehensive data model designed to provide a sound foundation for complex data exchange scenarios. Besides the provision of a large variety of data types for capturing the semantics of building elements and spaces, the {IFC} also makes it possible to define relationships between building elements and/or spaces, respectively. In particular, a spatial aggregation hierarchy can be modeled by successively applying the relationship {IfcRelAggregates} to space objects. However, no validation options currently exist to check whether the semantically defined aggregation hierarchy complies with the geometric setup of the individual spaces and building elements. This lack of consistency between the semantic and the geometric part of the {BIM} model may lead to serious data interpretation errors at the receiving end. To prevent this, we propose a new method for validating spatio-semantic consistency based on the usage of the Query Language for Building Information Models ({QL}4BIM) which on the one hand provides a means of accessing the {IFC} object model and on the other hand provides high-level spatial operators, such as Disjoint, Touching and Containing. The formulation of corresponding queries makes it possible to verify the spatio-semantic consistency of the {IFC} model. The paper discusses application scenarios and provides a number of relevant examples.},

Control or compliance checking are becoming more complex every day for industrials but also for organizations in charge of assessing the conformity of new products or processes. This paper will detail the approach taken by the {CSTB} in order to simplify this compliance control task. The approach and the solutions proposed are based on semantic web technologies. For this purpose, we first elaborate a domain-ontology, which defines the main concepts involved and the relationships among them based on {OWL}. We rely on {SBVR} and {SPARQL} to reformulate the regulatory requirements written in natural language in a controlled and formal language. We structure then our control process based on expert practices. Each elementary control step is defined as a {SPARQL} query and assembled into complex control processes " on demand " according to the component tested and its semantic definition. Finally, we represent in {RDF} the association between the {SBVR} rules and {SPARQL} queries representing the same regulatory constraints.},

	abstract = {The Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) are a prevalent data model in which Building Information Models can be exchanged, typically with a file-based nature. Processing the full extent of these models can be time-consuming. Considering the multi-disciplinary nature of the construction industry, stakeholders will typically only be interested in a small subset, depending on the purpose of the exchange. Therefore, the retrieval of relevant subsets, whether spatially, based on discipline, or others, is necessary to effectively consume such datasets in downstream applications. Prevalent encoding forms of {IFC} models are text-based and do not facilitate random-access seeking within the file and do not impose an ordering on the definition of elements within the file. Therefore, typically, the entire file needs to be read in order to find the data of interest. Furthermore, text-based data is slower to parse in comparison to binary data. This paper assesses a binary serialization format originating from the family of {EXPRESS} standards. It is based on an existing open, binary, hierarchical data format called {HDF}5 that allows random access to specific instances and therefore efficient retrieval of relevant subsets. The block-level, transparent compression yields a reduction of file sizes as compared to traditional serializations. Fully specified datatypes embedded in the exchange guarantee interoperable use. In this paper, several serialization profiles are introduced that cater to specific use cases by governing storage settings. Advanced functionality from the {HDF}5 library is applied to offer novel paradigms for fine-grained access rights, varying level of detail, revision management and aggregation of aspect models.},

	abstract = {The Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) are a common file-based open standard to describe Building Information Models. An {IFC} file can describe a building model to a level of detail suitable for production use and unite information pertaining to all stakeholders involved in a construction project. {IFC} files can possibly constitute up to gigabytes of data. Processing the full extent of this data can be time consuming. Considering the multi-disciplinary nature of our industry it may also be unnecessary for the use case at hand. Therefore, the retrieval of relevant subsets, whether spatially, based on discipline, or others, is necessary to effectively consume such datasets in downstream applications.
However, prevalent encoding forms of {IFC} models are text-based. And even though, in terms of file size, the most prevalent encoding, called {IFC}-{SPF}, can be rather efficient, by nature, it does not facilitate random access seeking in the file and no ordering is imposed to the definition of elements in the file. Therefore, at worst, the entire file needs to be traversed in order to find instances of interest. Furthermore, text-based data is slow to parse in comparison to its binary equivalent.
This paper introduces a binary serialization for {IFC} models as an alternative to prevalent text-based formats. It is based on an existing open standard called {HDF}5. An implementation for the translation of conventional {IFC} instance models into {HDF}5 is provided under and open source license. {HDF}5 is a binary and hierarchical data format. The hierarchical nature allows random access to specific instances. Other benefits include transparent compression and mechanisms for linking and mounting external files. The compressed {HDF}5 format yields a significant reduction of file sizes as compared to {IFC}-{SPF} models. In three use cases is assessed that extracting data from the model, can occur in near-constant time in relation to the size of the model, contrary to linear time using {IFC}-{SPF} models.
The translation into {HDF}5 files follows an existing {ISO} standardized mapping from {EXPRESS} instance models, the parent standard of {IFC}. The self-documenting nature of {HDF}5 enables incorporating additional attributes that are not part of the schema. In order to improve visualisation one can cache calculated information such as triangulated geometry for complex {CSG} geometries that are computationally complex to compute. In addition, incorporating inverse attribute values as part of the instantiation allows to further optimize the generation of subgraphs.},

	abstract = {Multi-disciplinary and long-term use of geometric and semantic construction information
With the transition to Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) within the construction
sector, industry stakeholders exchange detailed building engineering information in
semantic and computer readable formats. The Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) are
the main open and vendor neutral standard according to which this information is
structured. Open issues arise when extending and generalizing the use of {IFC} data
to other related disciplines, such as cultural heritage documentation, digital long-
term preservation, land registration and cadastral management, geospatial analysis,
building asset management and civil engineering. These issues originate from the use
of unrelated ontologies, mismatching levels of detail, different geometric modeling
paradigms,inefficientstorageofinformation,lackoffullfeaturedquerylanguagesand
no means for mutation management. This dissertation is aimed at alleviating some
of the technical complications of multi-disciplinary and long-term use of building
models.
To provide more efficient storage mechanisms for {IFC} instance models, a binary
format is introduced, based on the open {HDF}5 standard for scientific computing. Re-
quired storage space and access times to specific information is decimated relating to
the state of the art of clear-text encoding of exchange models, by means of the hier-
archical and fixed-length storage of instances, an instantiation of inverse attributes,
machine-native storage of number literals and transparently applied block-level com-
pression. Storage space is reduced to as little as 11\% of original encoding for large
models, but the most profound reduction is in access times to descriptive meta-data,
whichcanbederivedinaslittleas0.0067\%to3.5\%ofthetimerequiredonthecurrently
prevalent formats, for simple tasks and more elaborate tasks respectively. Due to the
self-descriptive storage paradigm and optionally applied checksum filters, advances
are made to resilient long-term digital storage. Advanced features such as internal ref-
erences and mounting, assembling various files by the end-user, contribute to specific
use cases in industry such as varying levels of detail and the aggregation of several
aspect models provided independently by different stakeholders.
Currently, the most viable options to query for information encoded in building
models are provided by the standards and tools that are part of the Semantic Web
ecosystem, with in particular {RDF} as a generic storage method and {SPARQL} as a
query language. Those generic {RDF} tools are compared to querying the novel binary
serialized models directly, with an implemented {SPARQL} query engine that operates
directly on top of this format, eliminating additional indirections that stem from the
{RDF} conversion process. No additional optimization or indexing step is necessary as
opposed to the state of the art {RDF} storage engines, due to the efficient storage. As
such, the approach presented in this dissertation yields the most succinct queryable
format for {BIM} models and is fastest in some of the cases where query paths follow
the direction in which attributes are defined in {IFC}.
Due to the complicated and implicit definitions of the geometric engineering con-
structs in {BIM} models, querying and reasoning on such geometric constructs directly
without a prior evaluation step is not feasible. Especially in the context of the Se-
mantic Web, such constructs cannot be efficiently stored due to the use of ordered
sequences for example for polygonal boundaries. In this dissertation an alternative
description of {IFC} geometries is provided as Well-Known Text, a standard originating
from the geospatial domain for human readable and explicit geometry definitions
with well-defined semantics and relational predicates. Comparing to the original
{RDF} representation of {IFC}, for specific files, a reduction in triple counts of up to 96\% is
achieved. Formoregeneralfilesfromindustryreductionsof44\%and52\%arerealized.
Procedures are provided to translate the product-centric solid geometries of build-
ing elements into representations that cater to other modeling paradigms, such as (a)
thermal analysis, where thin-walled interfaces between thermal zones are required
and (b) geospatial analysis where a complete manifold building envelope is desired
for topological and geometrical queries.

{themanuallymodeledIFCengineeringgeometrieswithpointcloudsdirectlyobtained}
from acquisition devices. For this purpose a minimal schema extension is provided
that, with an addition of 13 new entities, enables to efficiently express, annotate and
link point cloud segments to individual building elements. Due to the various inde-
pendent layers of compression: grid discretization, quantization and general purpose
compression at the file format level, a 68\% compression ratio is obtained compared
to the independent storage of point cloud and building model separately. In addi-
tion to change detection, the confluence of point cloud and building model facilitates
use cases such as structural health monitoring to assess the gradual deflections that
elements incur over time and hybrid modeling approaches for detailed ornaments in
digital cultural heritage documentation.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of Building Information Modelling ({BIM}), the construction industry is rapidly catching up with the digital revolution that has boosted productivity in virtually all economic sectors. In current practice, the focus of {BIM} lies on exchange of documents, often through proprietary formats exchanged using the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}). However, with web technologies such as {RDF}, {OWL} and {SPARQL}, a data- and web-based {BIM} paradigm becomes within reach. The decentralisation of data and decoupling of information and applications will enhance a more general adoption of Big Open {BIM}, and is expected to lower the {BIM} threshold for smaller companies that are active in different phases of the building life cycle. Since one of the promises of the Semantic Web and Linked Data is a highly improved interoperability between different disciplines, it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel for the setup of an infrastructure that supports such a network of decentralised tools and data. In this paper, we evaluate the specifications provided by the Solid project (Inrupt Inc.), a Linked Data-based ecosystem for Social Linked Data. Although the exemplary use case of the Solid ecosystem is decentralisation of data and applications for social network purposes, we notice a considerable overlap with recent ambitions and challenges for a web-based {AECO} industry (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation). This includes standardised data representations, role- or actor-based authorisation and authentication and the need for modular and extensible applications, dedicated to a specific use case. After a brief introduction to Linked Data and its applications in the building industry, we discuss present solutions for building data management (Common Data Environments, multimodels, etc.). In order to translate these approaches towards a Linked Data context with minimal effort and maximal effect, we then review the Solid specifications for use in a construction-oriented web ecosystem. As a proof of concept, we discuss the setup of a web-service for creation and management of Linked Building Data, generated with the Solid-React generator. This application is envisaged as a bridge between the multiple data stores of different project stakeholders and the end user. It acts as an interface to a distributed Common Data Environment that also allows the generation of multi-models.},

Objective: This paper proposes one of the possible implementations of a facility data model utilizing the concept of ontology as part of the contemporary Semantic Web paradigm. Method: The proposed facility ontology model was defined and developed to model all the static knowledge (such as technical vendor data, proprietary data types, and communication protocols) related to the significant energy consumers of the target infrastructure. Furthermore, this paper describes the overall methodology and how the common semantics offered by the ontology were utilized to improve the interoperability and energy management of complex infrastructures. Initially, a core facility ontology, which represents the generic facility model providing the general concepts behind the modelling, was defined. Results: In order to develop a full-blown model of the specific facility infrastructure, Malpensa and Fiumicino airports in Italy were taken as a test-bed platform in order to develop the airport ontology owing to the variety of the technical systems installed at the site. For the development of the airport ontology, the core facility ontology was first extended and then populated to reflect the actual state of the target airport facility. Conclusion: The developed ontology was tested in the environment of the two pilots, and the proposed solution proved to be a valuable link between separate {ICT} systems involving equipment from various vendors, both on syntax and semantic level, thus offering the facility managers the ability to retrieve high-level information regarding the performance of significant energy consumers.},

However, {BIM} has predominantly generated value in the design phase of a project, while the potential benefits in the construction phase have been disregarded for many years and are now gaining importance. Trending advancements try to utilize existing {BIM} data, e.g by linking a digital building model with planning efforts of the construction project and create new knowledge to improve construction. In this paper, we are interested in exploring how semantic models and Linked Building Data ({LBD}) can support value creation in the construction phase. The presented use case tries to answer the question how the planning of Temporary Construction Items ({TCIs}) can be improved by semantically describing and classifying {TCIs} in an ontology that allows to utilize {TCI} information with {BIM} data. {TCIs} only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the creation of an ontology in this field shall lead to a better and more automated consideration of {TCIs} in construction planning. Here, we follow the recommendation of the W3C - {LBD} community group to extend or develop new ontologies and propose the {TCI} ontology as the main contribution. We first introduce the {TCI} ontology and its relation to other ontologies. Then we demonstrate the value of the ontology by answering competency questions and finally provide a proof of concept of planning {TCIs} by utilizing the new ontology. The proposal of the {TCI} ontology is accompanied by a second ontology for Location-Based Scheduling ({LBS}) to consider the time dimension of planning. The main focus, however, lies on the development and presentation of the {TCI} ontology whereas the {LBS} ontology will be further developed in future research.},

This `federated' reality contrasts with the concept of a `centralised' cloud server; a `Common Data Environment' ({CDE}). In this paper, we propose a basic infrastructure for a `federated {CDE}', using domain-agnostic Web specifications for (access-controlled) data federation. This infrastructure is illustrated via a proof-of-concept implementation, based on the open-source Community Solid Server.},

	abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are starting to be deployed in complex built environments where they need to navigate to complete the given tasks. In order to navigate, autonomous mobile robots often rely on environmental maps. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to automatically create topological and metric environmental maps from {BIM} data exported to a graph database. We define queries on the exported graph data-base which retrieve the data needed to create the maps automatically. We validate our approach by applying standard path planning algorithms such as A* on the generated maps showing that they are suitable for computing optimal paths. We regard this work as a first step to connect linked data methods to robotics algorithms and use-cases. The results show the feasibility and potential of exploiting the semantic richness of the data available from {BIM}.},

	url = {https://linkedbuildingdata.net/ldac2021/files/papers/CIB_W78_2021_paper_122.pdf},
	abstract = {The {BIM} Collaboration Format ({BCF}) is a {buildingSMART} standard used to exchange issues in a digital model between heterogeneous software applications and planners. Although the {BCF} issues are spatially located in a model and provide links to building elements, the format is only loosely connected to the actual {BIM} model. While the format is well suited for its original use case, it lacks the flexibility to retrieve information from the {BCF} in conjunction with the {BIM} model. In this paper, we introduce the {BIM} Collaboration Format Ontology ({bcfOWL}), which translates the format to the Semantic Web and harnesses the expressive richness of {OWL}. We present the structure of the ontology and highlight the di erences with existing implementations of {BCF}. Using example queries, we show how extended relationships between a {BIM} model and {BCF} information are enabled by {bcfOWL}. We show that by transferring {BCF} to Linked Data, the format's applicability is enhanced without losing compatibility with existing implementations and workflows. In doing so, the ontology aims to integrate into the Linked Building Data environment and facilitates access to synergies between heterogeneous building data.},

	abstract = {The {AEC} sector is known to be highly fragmented, different experts requiring different information. Current {BIM} collaborative practices can be described as static as they are based on file exchange, mainly using {IFC} files. Instead, in an ideal level 3 {BIM} platform, different stakeholders could work together on a single centralized building model, using different domain-specific vocabularies, and updating the model synchronously. We propose an approach based on semantic rule reasoning to dynamically convert information in different vocabularies. While existing alignments only cover class conversions, we develop inference rules that handle conversion of relations in a dynamic and transparent way, being executed by a reasoner. The approach is implemented and tested on converting models from {ifcOWL} to {BIM}4Ren, a {BOT}-based ontology. The scalability of the implementation is discussed as well as its limitation.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an approach to automatically convert the German data model for documenting infrastructure inspections ({ASB}-{ING}) into a semantic ontology. Thus, an extensive data model is created that enables the representation of infrastructure and maintenance-related facts in Linked Data and is compatible with the German standards and guidelines. The national standard "{ASB}-{ING}" contains about 120 classes and 500 attributes to describe a bridge or tunnel and its damages. It is the basis for the relational database program "{SIB}-Bauwerke", in which most bridges in Germany are recorded over the last 20 years. By converting the {ASB}-{ING} model into an Ontology, compatibility with this extensive available data set is ensured, enabling a direct translation of the existing asset data into Linked Data models. Concurrently, it is possible to relate the classes of this national data model with classes of other national or international ontologies. By mapping the {ASB}-{ING} Ontology to {ifcOWL}, the formerly only tabular data can be linked to standardised geometry models without requiring additionally developed geometric representation. Interlinking the {ASB}-{ING} Ontology with other international and national infrastructure data models can improve asset information exchange of cross-border projects.},

@inproceedings{odonnellEnablingMultiscaleEnergy2021,
	title = {Enabling Multi-scale Energy Modelling through a Linked-Data Approach},
	abstract = {This presentation describes the use of linked data approaches to permit queries across large, diverse information sources to allow reasoning about complex questions at multiple geographic scales. The developed methodology leverages a central spine model that provides a common hierarchical context; various heterogeneous external information sources can be associated with these contexts, creating a homogeneous data network that can be queried using federated {SPARQL} queries. These distributed sources are, in themselves, registered in a central catalogue in order to facilitate data discovery; the actual data, however, remains under the control of their source organisations. In this way a large, extensible, interconnected network of distributed data describing a built environment can be constructed; this network can be queried centrally to provide customised views of subsets of the data.. The utility of the architecture is demonstrated by establishing a data network to support Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute ({ESRI}) analysts to investigate the impact of various decarbonisation scenarios on the Irish transmission grid. An instance of the Dynamic District Information Model ({DDIM}) server was used for this analysis. Large datasets were necessary to support this investigation, including details of 220 transmission nodes, c.16,500 small areas and approximately 2 million residential buildings. A series of residential energy archetypes were developed, including as-is and energy consumption per residence archetype for numerous scenarios, including the adoption of heat pumps and electric vehicles. It was found that the {DDIM} approach enabled integration of large scale and heterogeneous datasets, finer grained data analysis, and improved the accuracy of the analysis.},

	abstract = {Linking heterogeneous information models from the domains Building In-formation Modelling ({BIM}) and Geospatial Information Systems ({GIS}) enables syner-getic effects between these domains. A common approach to define links between cor-responding objects are identity relation like owl:{sameAs} from the Web Ontology Lan-guage ({OWL}). Identity relations suggests that everything stated about one entity hold for the corresponding entity (i.e., they share all of their properties). However, this kind of semantics is too strict for linking objects from heterogeneous information models. This paper shows the issue of the strict semantics of identity relations for linking build-ing elements of heterogeneous information models like Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) and {CityGML}. In more detail, related literature about heterogeneities and links between {IFC} and {CityGML} are reviewed. Afterwards, the issue caused by the strict semantics of identity links for linking {IFC} and {CityGML} models is illustrated and al-ternative approaches to identity links are discussed. As a result, identity links are prone to be misleading for linking building elements represented in Industry Foundation Clas-ses ({IFC}) and {CityGML} models. However, alternative linking approaches have the short coming that they generally rely on the correct interpretation of the user.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is driving a new wave of large-scale datafication in every aspect of our world. Today our society creates data ecosystems where data moves among actors within complex information supply chains that can form around an organization, community, sector, or smart environment. These ecosystems of data can be exploited to transform our world and present new challenges and opportunities in the design of intelligent systems. This talk presents my recent work on using the dataspace paradigm as a best-effort approach to data management within data ecosystems. The talk explores the theoretical foundations and principles of dataspaces and details a set of specialized best-effort techniques and models to enable loose administrative proximity and semantic integration of heterogeneous data sources. Finally, I share my perspectives on future dataspace research challenges, including multimedia data, data governance and the role of dataspaces to enable large-scale data sharing within Europe to power data-driven {AI}.},

	title = {Integration of Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control processes in the {BIM} methodology for Infrastructures},
	abstract = {In {AECO} industry (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation), {BIM} methodology is consolidated as the most efficient way to design, build, operate, maintain and demolish infrastructures by i) achieving the digital representation of the infrastructure including geometric and non-geometric information, ii) allowing for a more efficient collaborative work among the different stakeholders and disciplines, and iii) covering all the phases in the infrastructure life cycle (from the planning and design up to the demolition). However, some disciplines are not properly integrated within the workflows of {BIM} methodology. Therefore, the related information is not properly integrated in the As-Built {BIM} model of the infrastructure and it is not shared among stakeholders following {BIM} standards. This is the case of the Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control activities accomplish during the planning, design and construction processes of the infrastructure life cycle. This is the challenged tackled by the R\&I project {ICONYC} developed by the Engineering Company {CEMOSA}, funded by the Spanish Government, and presented here. Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control are core activities for {CEMOSA}. In the {ICONYC} project, {CEMOSA} has developed a methodology to integrate such processes within the {BIM} workflow allowing for the digital transformation of these activities. This presentation will describe the i) Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control processes workflows; ii) the mobile apps for field data gathering (geotechnical drilling, surveys, inspections and samples) developed in {SAP} Fiori; iii) the apps for the information analysis (tests, incidences, communications, geotechnical layers, etc) developed on {SAP} {ERP}; iv) the apps for the generation of the Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control {BIM} models developed by means of {APIs} from {XBIM} and Revit and, v) the Common Data Environment ({CDE}) which allows the sharing of site information (including documents, {BIM} models, {CAD} drawings, inspection, surveys, samples, incidences…) and management information (tasks, milestones, communications, stakeholders…) among all the participants. The {CDE} has been developed based on {SAP} Fiori, Autodesk {BIM}360 and Autodesk Forge. In addition, it will be described the Data Model to store on {SAP} {ERP} the information related to the Quality Control (batch, inspections, surveys, check points, samples, tests, incidences, communications, etc.) and the Geotechnical Investigations (drillings, samples, tests, geotechnical layers, etc) as well as the mapping of said Data Model with the {IFC} classes schema and the definition of the property sets to store the relevant quality control and geotechnical information. The integration of Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control processes into the {BIM} methodology produce a more accurate As-Build {BIM} Model, including the actual characteristics of the infrastructure executed and allowing for a better traceability of the control processes carried out and, consequently, a greater guarantee on the debugging of responsibilities in possible future infrastructure ‘s pathologies as well as a reduction in the possible mistakes in the integration of geotechnical parameters and, therefore, achieving a more optimised foundation designs. All of this reverts in a better collaboration among all stakeholders in a more cost-effective way.},

	abstract = {Building information modeling ({BIM}) allows representation of de-tailed information regarding building elements while geographic information system ({GIS}) allows representation of spatial information about buildings and their surroundings. Overlapping these domains will combine their individual fea-tures and provide support to important activities such as building emergency re-sponse, construction site safety, construction supply chain management, and sus-tainable urban design. Interoperability through open data standards is one method of connecting software tools from {BIM} and {GIS} domains. However, no single open data standard available today can support all information from the two do-mains. As a result, many researchers have been working to overlap or connect different open data standards to enhance interoperability. An overview of these studies will help identify the different approaches used and determine the ap-proach with the most potential to enhance interoperability. This paper adopted a strong definition of interoperability using information technology ({IT}) based standard documents. Based on this definition, previous approaches towards im-proving interoperability between {BIM} and {GIS} applications through open data standards were studied. The result shows previous approaches have implemented data conversion, data integration, and linked data approaches. Between these methods, linked data emerged as having the most potential to connect open data standards and expand interoperability between {BIM} and {GIS} applications be-cause it allows information exchange without editing the original data. The paper also identifies the main challenges in implementing linked data technologies for interoperability and provides directions for future research.},

@inproceedings{pruvostOntologybasedBuildingEnergy2021,
	title = {Ontology-based Building Energy System Commissioning and Monitoring},
	abstract = {"Ontology-based Building Energy System Commissioning and Monitoring": Commissioning and operating building energy systems necessitates much configuration and testing work of the building monitoring and automation system. Generally suppliers and installers use singular proprietary software systems and customized monitoring databases. Once setup and in operation, there is also no guarantee that the building is energy-efficient and most of time building users themselves act as energy wasting factors due to their wrong usage of the building energy system. As a response, the presented work aims at developing an expert system that shall ease the transition between design and operation as well as provide live recommendations for a continuous commissioning of the building energy system. For that purpose, it relies on Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) and Semantic Web technologies. The presented approach tries then to bring a complementary added value to classical building automation and control systems ({BACS}) by the means of semantic modeling and knowledge reuse for semantic analysis and characterization of the building energy system and its operational conditions. For that purpose, it implements a knowledge base of energy conservation measures and potential operating errors that prescribe energy-efficiency actions and handlings to building users or a facility managers. The system consumes for a part building data gathered during its operation through a monitoring system. For another part, it relies on metadata contained in initial {BIM}-compliant building design models. The resulting software application might be used in the future as an add-on to existing building management systems ({BMS}). Modern {BMS} are able to handle a huge amount of data that are analyzed for supervising, controlling and benchmarking buildings. {BMS} data are mainly gained through sensors and meters that provide information about e.g. the operational state of technical equipment, indoor temperature or energy consumption. Because of its highly time-dependent nature, this kind of information can be categorized as dynamic data about a building in contrast to static data which represent the building and its technical systems as they are i.e. as built physical entities. This latter kind of information encompasses data about the energy system components, their technical characteristics and their layout in the building. Even if numerous dynamic data are produced during building operation there is no much use of building static information created during its design. In view of that, the proposed methodology aims at closing this informational gaps between building design and operation by making reuse of initial design models serialized in {IFC}. The intrinsic relationships between dynamic and static data are then represented into some ontologies and analyzed by means of logical reasoning. In existing {BMS} those relationships are semantically poor and only contained partially in the backend data model of the {BMS}, like a relational database in most cases. The proposed semantic building information model is then used for interpreting building energy system behaviors and identifying best energy conservation measures. More specifically, an energy system ontology together with a risk ontology are introduced to support reuse of knowledge for optimized building operation.},

Therefore, a knowledge-based approach has been developed, which utilizes web ontologies to store building and damage information in a semantic representation and processes them in an automated assessment via predefined rulesets. The concept is specified and applied for structures made of natural stone and is specifically tested and verified on the common case of a damaged façade.

	abstract = {Higher building performance saves operational costs, helps sustaina-bility goals, and increases the comfort, satisfaction, productivity, and health of occupants. However, models simulating the occupants’ perceived performance of indoor environments require highly heterogeneous input data. This paper aims to show how semantic web technologies can help to overcome problems deriving from this heterogeneity issue. Literature is studied to categorize the necessary input information for modeling occupants’ perceived building performance. Two perspectives were consulted, namely the Indoor Environmental Quality approach and the Healing Environments approach. Based on the results, a core {IEQ} data model, integrating building topology, static properties, and dynamic properties, is proposed. We introduced a method to integrate this information by using the Building Performance Ontology ({BOP}). This method was tested by manually transforming the Open Smart Home ({OSH}) data to {BOP} vocabulary. Time-series data from various sensors were stored in {InfluxDB} and connected to the linked building data. A custom-built python tool was created to compute the thermal comfort of the {OSH} using the {PMV}/{PPD} method. The results indicate that a com-mon data structure for static and dynamic properties helps to integrate the heter-ogeneity input data. Furthermore, we showed that adding occupants’ data or sys-tem information could improve thermal comfort through multiple reactive ap-proaches.},

@inproceedings{argyrisSimplifyingDeliveryICDD2021,
	title = {Simplifying the delivery of {ICDD} containers based on the {ISO}-21597},
	abstract = {What we're looking for in this proposal is a way to simplify the delivery of {ICDD} containers, following the {ISO}-21597. Considering the great value of delivering {AECO} projects based on open standards in a future-proof way, {ICDD} containers prove to be an important tool towards this direction. However, to raise the level of adoption of such initiatives, there is a lot of space for making the process more accessible to a wider range of users. Our contribution is targeting the end-to-end procedure of producing the {ICDD} container in a painless way for non-experts through a simple web-based interface, together with an {API} for developers. More specifically our approach is split into three main steps: 1) After the user specifies the directory with all the (local) project files, a Python script produces the {ISO}-defined file structure, while parsing all the available metadata from the files. 2) Then, the user adjusts the parsed information and fills up the rest, while defining links between the files. 3) The information, which is initially registered as an associative array, is processed and transformed into an {RDF} graph. The interface is designed in a way that guarantees the appropriate usage of the ontology’s entities and relations, as well as the proper literal data types without the explicit definition by the user. Additionally, {SHACL} will be used in the final processing step to verify the compliance to the {ISO} ontology. The whole directory, having been suitably configured, is zipped into the {ICDD} format. Furthermore, the backend code can be exposed through a standalone {API}, which accepts a properly formatted {JSON} file and produces the “index” and “linkset” {RDF} files. The {API} is considered especially useful for projects involving a big amount of files with repetitive link patterns, where batch data processing is more feasible than manual configuration. This option can also be considered as additional to step “2”, through the injection of the extracted link information to the interface. Finally, we are looking closely at approaches that aim to combine the {ISO}-21597 with broader data linking projects like {openCDE} etc. We would also like to open the discussion on how additional synergies with more low-level ontologies like {BOT} or {BRICK} can be achieved.},

Semantic web technologies enable further improvement of the interoperability by linking information on data level using a global unique identification key in a web-based decentralized data store. To contribute to these developments, a brief literature review covering representations of building service systems such as {IfcOWL}, {BRICK}, {SAREF} and a comparison of their scopes and core concepts is given. Based on these findings, recent developments regarding the {TUBES} system ontology ({TSO}) and their alignment to the Building Topology Ontology ({BOT}) are presented. {TSO} strives to represent interconnected building service systems and their exchange of energy, mass and data on different levels of granularity based on the general system theory.

@inproceedings{voskuilWhyAssetData2021,
	title = {Why Asset Data Must Be {FAIR}: The {SIDO} Case},
	abstract = {Managing infrastructure assets — street furniture, buildings, escalators, landing guidance systems, toilet doors — requires data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable: {FAIR} data. Making this happen is a huge challenge. But succeed and you get much more value from your assets. By optimizing the planning of maintenance work, Dutch rail infrastructure company {ProRail} managed to cut maintenance cost by 10\%. Data can yield enormous value but making them {FAIR} takes effort. In this presentation, we report some of the results of a small-scale proof of concept called {SIDO} and will demonstrate the core functionality of the solution we created. It shows that projects to make data {FAIR} can be small in scope and still yield immediate benefits. Thus, the {FAIR} data challenge can be met in a stepwise manner. The {SIDO}-case is about sharing data between parties that do work under ground. Better methods of sharing data make it possible to better coordinate planning. The result is that a street needs to be closed for digging only once, while multiple parties execute their maintenance work on their separate underground assets. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management took the initiative for the project and funded it, and it was executed with Evides, the water company of the Rotterdam region, and other parties that own underground assets in the same area. Together with {CGI}, we at Taxonic realized a solution based on free open-source components, delivering a prototype of a {SIDO}-cooperation space based on {FAIR} data. Data science techniques are promising, but creating {FAIR} data already starts yielding benefits even when more modest goals are pursued. {FAIR} data can lead to significant improvements in essential, basic primary processes where data science plays no role (yet). To introduce {FAIR} data in an organisation, small incremental steps can be taken, each with a solid business case. This is what the {SIDO}-case is about. Utility companies must be able to gain access to their equipment under ground. These works need to be coordinated to minimize cost and traffic disruption. There is a great potential for cooperation, and of course efforts are made to make this happen — in the past and present. But cooperation is easier said than done. Data about underground assets are sensitive and not to be shared irresponsibly. We created a {FAIR} data solution to support this. The essential ingredient of the solution is a semantic data model in {RDF}, including some {OWL} and {SHACL}. When asset owners publish data about planned works conforming to this semantic model, other asset owners can instantly see with whom they might cooperate when planning their works. We will relate the {SIDO} case to other real-world developments in the asset management domain where {RDF}-based solutions play a central role. Also, we will demo the functionality of the {SIDO} solution.},

Most of the studies on {BIM}-based construction safety inspection and prevention use data from the planning and design stage.

An automatic inspection mechanism integrating {BIM} and safety rules is constructed, and a presentation mechanism of intelligent detection results based on Natural Language Processing is designed. The construction process safety rule checking system was developed, and the effectiveness of the system was verified by a case study.

Many research and development efforts have been made for automated compliance checking of building designs with regulatory requirements, but there is a lack of a non-proprietary and user-understandable representation of building regulations to support automated compliance checking in the construction domain that is experimentally tested for understandability and reading speed. Methods
This research investigates a logic-based representation and tree-based visualization method for building regulatory requirements. The logic-based representation is based on classic logic programming language and can directly support automated compliance checking. The tree-based visualization is expected to improve the understandability and reading speed of the logic-based representation. Therefore, this method attempts to add to the limited research in non-proprietary and user-understandable representation of building regulations that is experimentally tested for understandability and reading speed. To test the understandability and reading speed of regulatory requirements using this representation and visualization method, a survey was conducted to compare different representations, namely, text, logic-based, and tree-based. {ResultsStatistical} analysis of the survey results shows that the proposed tree-based visualization method can significantly improve the understandability and reading speed of the logic-based regulatory requirement representation and this visualization method is at a comparable status with the original text representation of regulatory requirements in terms of understandability and reading speed. Conclusions(1) The investigated logic-based representation and tree-based visualization method for regulatory requirements serves as one potential non-proprietary and user-understandable representation of building regulations; (2) this research shows that computable representations of regulatory requirements can achieve understandability and reading speed that are comparable to the original text representation through tree-based visualization; and (3) this research reveals that the tree-based visualization of regulatory requirements improves the understandability and reading speed of regulatory requirements when such use is compared to the computable logic-based representation.},

	abstract = {A new {ACC} system that leverages semantic natural language processing ({NLP}) techniques to automatically extract information from regulatory documents and represent them in a logic based rule format is presented. A number of important efforts have been made, both in academia and industry, to automate the code compliance checking process. While important progress has been achieved, existing automated compliance checking ({ACC}) systems are not entirely automated; manual effort is needed for extracting regulatory requirements from codes and encoding them in a computer processable rule format. To address this gap, this paper presents a new {ACC} system that leverages semantic natural language processing ({NLP}) techniques to automatically extract information from regulatory documents and represent them in a logic based rule format. The proposed systems is composed of three modules: (1) semantic {NLP} based regulatory information extraction and transformation algorithms to automatically extract regulatory information from regulatory documents into semantic tuples and automatically transform the extracted regulatory information in semantic tuples into logic rules; (2) semantic rule based design information extraction and transformation algorithms to automatically extract design information from building information models and transform the design information into logic facts; and (3) a logic-based reasoning algorithm to automatically reason about the logic rules and facts and generate compliance checking reports. To test the performance of the proposed system, as a whole, and how the different algorithms are performing together as one unit for detecting noncompliance instances, the proposed algorithms were implemented and integrated into a proof-of-concept prototype. The prototype was tested in checking the compliance of a design test case with Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009, and the performance was evaluated in terms of precision and recall.},

Converting human-readable building regulations to computer-readable format is, however, still time-consuming and error-prone due to the nature of human languages. Several domain-independent efforts have been made for {NLP}, and this paper focuses on how computers can be able to understand semantic meaning of building regulations to intelligently automate rule interpretation process. This paper proposes a semantic analysis process of regulatory sentences and its utilization for rule checking system. The proposed process is composed of following steps: 1) learning semantics of words and sentences, 2) utilization of semantic analysis. For semantic analysis, we use word embedding technique which converts meaning of words in numerical values. By using those values, computers can extract related words and classify the topic of sentences. The results of the semantic analysis can elaborate the interpretation with domain-specific knowledge. This paper also shows a demonstration of the proposed approach.},

Our previous research introduced the {bcfOWL} ontology to express {BCF} data using the open Web of Data standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as part of the Linked Building Data ({LBD}). The current {BCF} {API} standard expresses changes in the model as event logs that indirectly describe the modifications. The focus is on different changes issue descriptions are going through in the course of a life cycle of a building. This paper presents four different approaches for expressing the temporal changes as Linked Data. Two {RDF}-star approaches and a state construction inspired by the Ontology for Property Management ({OPM}) are introduced. Moreover, we show Event System method that is close to the original {BCF} {API}. To compare the approaches, queries to get the current data and search the history are provided on an external repository.

Recently, technologies for re-decentralising the Web are causing furore, as they allow decoupling data storage from applications. The Solid initiative bundles these technologies in a domain-independent way. In previous work we have already discussed data patterns for the {AEC} industry, using these technologies - the {LBDserver}. In this paper, we demonstrate how these very generic data organisation patterns can be aligned with common industry standards - facilitating compatibility with existing, centralised approaches while maintaining the benefits of organising digital projects in a federated way.},

But data analysts in charge of developing these predictive models may feel overwhelmed if they have insufficient domain expertise. In this article, the ontology-driven approach proposed by the {EEPSA} (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) is presented, in which data analysts can benefit from previously captured domain knowledge to get support regarding which are the variables to consider when developing a model which accurately predicts the thermal comfort within buildings. Compared with the existing tools or methods, the {EEPSA} is able to suggest variables that may not necessarily be included in the set of data available. This fact has a big potential nowadays, where the Linked Open Data and the third-party repositories are valuable sources of knowledge which can be exploited to incorporate relevant information to the set of data available.},

	abstract = {Occupant-centric decision-making in buildings requires integrating occupant information with other building information. Semantic web technologies promise to reduce data interoperability issues. However, methods to discover occupants’ experiences and integrate those with linked building data are scarce. This paper aims to show how combining knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technology could lead to an improved understanding of occupants’ experiences in buildings. This approach is applied to a case study using the Open Family Home. An occupant collected feedback on various comfort indicators using a smartwatch app. Building information, sensor data, weather data, and occupant information and feedback were integrated into a cross-domain semantic digital twin. A Python script collected all the data from the digital twin and ran a data analysis, after which parameters that affected the occupant’s experience were collected. The results were transformed into triples and integrated with the linked building data. This combination of knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technologies results in enriched digital twins that can be used for occupant-centric decision-making. The approach presented in this study was generalized into a four-step method that can be applied at a variety of use-cases in the architecture, engineering, and construction domain.},

As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives {AEC} application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. {IFC}) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, {BHoM}). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by modular disciplinary ontolo-gies, can provide a solid ground to share and exchange data flexibly.},

	abstract = {To increase the transparency of building systems amongst all stakeholders and to improve the efficiency throughout the building lifecycle, Bosch Building Technologies is providing an open-source library of ontologies and a series of smart building software services using Digital Twin ({DT}) technology. In this presentation, we would like to share our experiences using ontologies and {DT} for building comfort \& energy optimization. Firstly, a brief introduction to the Ontology Central will be made, which is an open-source Digital Twin Description Language ({DTDL}) ontology library for commercial buildings. Currently, three ontology models, namely the Foundation, Fire Alarm Systems, and {HVAC} Systems are provided and can be reused across buildings, systems, and services. Among them, the Foundation Ontology offers the digital common foundation layer for domain-specific ontologies and is motivated by several {RDF} ontology models e.g. Building Topology Ontology ({BOT}) and Brick. A pipeline that supports the conversion between the {DTDL} and {RDF} format is under development. Currently, a mapping between the Foundation ontology and the {BOT} ontology in perspective of space and asset is supported and will be presented. Afterwards, a smart analytic software service for building and its {HVAC} system called “{HVAC} Performance Analyzer” will be introduced, which deploys the Bosch ontologies and provides overall information about the building comfort as well as the system operation, based on the assessment of measured data. Several buildings of Bosch and its customers are on-boarded, monitored, and continuously managed by this service. Lastly, the successful deployment of the proposed ontology models as digital twin instances on the Microsoft Azure Digital Twin platform and corresponding analysis will be demonstrated. Smart building algorithms, called as Domain Expert Insight Models ({DEIMs}) for fault detection and predictive maintenance are developed. A proof-of-concept ({PoC}) study deploying the {DEIM} algorithm for energy optimization will be shown. Thanks to the {DT} and ontology models, the smart algorithms can be applied to other existing buildings without any modifications. The {PoC} study proves that {DT} plays a vital role in enabling scalable solutions to energy system optimization in the near future. One ongoing research of Bosch will be to onboard existing buildings with open-source {RDF} ontology and to enable further data analytics using semantic web technology. In summary, this presentation provides an overview of the development of ontology and {DT} applications of Bosch Building Technologies, which is believed to be invaluable to the facility management community.},

	url = {https://linkedbuildingdata.net/ldac2022/files/presentations/20220529_LDAC2022_Pruvost_v3.pdf},
	abstract = {The presented work discusses the potential application of ontologies for design automation in the building automation field. It relates to an ongoing implementation and related prototype being developed by an automation systems provider. Modern buildings have complex technical equipment which is hard to operate efficiently from a user’s point of view. Optimal commissioning and operation of building energy systems necessitate complex design and configuration of building automation and control systems ({BACS}). Generally, a {BACS} supplier or installer uses its own software system and customized monitoring databases. The presented approach tries to automate {BACS} setup relying on semantic modeling and knowledge reuse. It shall support the design and configuration of complex {BACS} systems by the means of automated characterization of the underlying building energy system and inferring of its most adapted control systems and strategies. For that purpose, it makes use of ontologies for modeling the topology of energy systems as well as emulating the knowledge of {BACS} design experts. Indeed, automation providers have much expert knowledge and experience in the design, evaluation and commissioning of energy system controls. It is investigated whether this manufacturer expertise can be represented via knowledge representation and model parameterization. A workflow is proposed that shall make it possible to support automated {BACS} design relying on a formalized description of {HVAC} systems from a wide variety of application fields using a generic templates library. For this purpose, existing energy systems are examined with regard to various structural properties such as topology, energy flows and control loop structures as well as needed sensors and monitoring functions. It is taken into account that the energy supply of buildings is planned individually to a high level of detail due to different system requirements. Therefore, an automated design of control systems requires the limitation and classification of possible system configurations. Knowledge about control concepts and controller architectures of distributed energy systems is required for the automatic generation of control architectures. This knowledge must be collected, systematized and stored appropriately. At the beginning, relevant controller concepts and controller architectures for the application in the targeted energy system are selected and described. A component library contains models for controllers and energy system components as well as buildings and plant models. For this purpose, it is necessary to create tools that allow the semi-automatic generation and testing of such components from the library. A prototype is being implemented inside design software of {IFM} automation solutions provider in cooperation with Fraunhofer.},

	title = {Implementing an O\&G Digital Commissioning System linking data through {ifcJSON}},
	abstract = {Oil and Gas industrial plants commissioning processes are vital to assure quality and safety performance in operations. Also, reducing commissioning lead-time allows fast operation and more significant financial results. However, the on-site procedures of inspection and tests are mostly still managed by conventional ways paper-work-based, although some applications based on information technologies (e.g., tablets and {PDF} files) have already started to bring digital solutions to the field, that is not enough. Lacking interoperability is a persistent issue that inhibits process-oriented management. From this, {CERTI} Foundation, a Centres of Reference in Innovative Technologies, and an O\&G Company from Brazil deployed a research and technological development project to implement a solution that allows middle-users to model and deploy on-site commissioning process-task-based. Also, workers and inspectors can receive and record on mobile devices the activities information. An Information Delivery Manual ({IDM}), {ISO}/{DIS} 29481-1 (2014), is performed to capture the current business process integrating all stakeholders (e.g., O\&G company, system providers, and new system developers). The Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) {ISO} 16739:2018 is adopted as a neutral language and open data format to collaborate data between the new system developed for the owner O\&G company and their suppliers to achieve high agility supply chains. An {ifcJSON}-4 version in sync with {IFC} {EXPRESS} Schema was developed to extend {IFC} to O\&G Commissioning management information. It is totally queryable ({CRUD} operations) via {REST} {API}, allowing clients to access the exact information of interest. We have then translated the {IFC} data model into {RDF}, and we are currently working on semantic enrichment of the data in order to achieve new levels of queryable data and intelligent automatic inferences. This work presents the latest data schemas developed for the O\&G sector and the proof of concepts conducted. Finally, the discussions lead to some conclusions as the commissioning processes need to be faster while maintaining security for workers, and the first step is standardising its information. Nothing is better than using neutral and universal formats, and {IFC} fits to achieve this. The second step is making the information available to end-users, and {REST} {APIs} to query {IFC} data do the work. The third step is to enrich the data model semantically, and again {IFC} might provide a shortcut to that by {ifcOWL}. We need then to continue the enrichment process by diving deeper into semantics and linked data in order to enable automatic inferences capability. The project's future directions are concerning the creation of a semantic web data model, which will be the basis for using {AI} in conjunction with a high-capacity data bus, to automatically detect bottlenecks in the commissioning process.},

The ontological model is composed of concepts, relations, and axioms. Concepts represent the "things" in the domain of interest; relations establish the interconcept links; and axioms specify the definitions of concepts and relations and constraints on their behavior and interpretation. The ontology models the most fundamental concepts in the domain in a structured, extendable, and flexible format to facilitate future evolution and extension of the ontology for representing application-specific and/or enterprise-specific knowl-edge. The ontology was evaluated through technical evaluation and user evaluation. User evaluation was conducted through one-to-one expert evaluation interviews.},

The reduction of energy (heating, domestic hot water, and appliances consumption) aims for the vision of near-zero energy consumption as a requirement goal for constructing buildings. In this paper, we review the available standards, tools and frameworks on the energy performance of buildings. Additionally, this work investigates if energy performance ratings can be obtained with energy consumption data from {IoT} devices and if the floor size and energy consumption values are enough to determine a dwellings’ energy performance rating. The essential outcome of this work is a data-driven prediction tool for energy performance labels that can run automatically. The tool is based on the cutting edge {kNN} classification algorithm and trained on open datasets with actual building data such as those coming from the {IoT} paradigm. Additionally, it assesses the results of the prediction by analysing its accuracy values. Furthermore, an approach to semantic annotations for energy performance certification data with currently available ontologies is presented. Use cases for an extension of this work are also discussed in the end.},

	abstract = {Data from building automation and control systems are becoming more and more important, since they are used in a growing number of (novel and established) analytics applications such as fault detection \&amp; diagnostics ({FDD}), smart maintenance and optimization. However, the quality of such data is often poor due to erroneous installation, commissioning, data recording or meta-information. In addition, building automation engineering and service departments usually focus on implementing and maintaining basic control functionality – data acquisition, tagging quality, and analytics do often not take priority. Due to these data quality issues, a first important step in any data analytics operation is to ensure data integrity. One main goal of data integrity checks is to increase data reliability. The paper presents such checks for building automation applications, in particular three different types of plausibility checks for time series data: single signal tests, similarity tests, and reaction tests. Examples using data recorded from real building automation project are presented for each of the three check types, demonstrating the usefulness of these checks. Data integrity checks are set up and configured using the available metadata which – in our case – comes in the form of semantic models that are automatically generated from building automation engineering data. Many data integrity checks have been identified that are potentially of great benefit in practice – both as a stand-alone application or as first part in a data analytics process. The major prerequisite for successful data integrity checking is that the checks can be set up with minimal effort and executed periodically. To achieve a high degree of automation, semantic data is of great importance, because it is through them that the recorded time series are provided with context and meaning. The automatically generated semantic models from building automation engineering proved to be already rich in automation information and are sufficient for many of the checks investigated.},

	abstract = {Construction projects have temporary fragmented supply chains that face many challenges, such as lack of trust, inadequate knowledge management, and poor communication. These challenges led to poor performance in terms of low productivity, high cost, schedule delay, and poor quality. Construction is a conservative industry resists changes to its structure and adoption of technology and new management principles. The study aims to develop a value stream mapping and information management frameworks for construction projects. The developed frameworks can support the elimination of wastes and facilitate the integration of the construction supply chain, which ultimately reduce the project’s cost and lead time. It can also support the current shift towards Industry 4.0, which targets the enabling of Construction 4.0. Surveys and interviews are conducted to determine existing tools to exchange information, the extent of value stream mapping ({VSM}) adoption, and the key performance indicators in Alberta. The results show Alberta’s industry mainly depends on face-to-face discussions, phones, and emails to exchange information. The knowledge most likely stays at the individual levels and neither shared nor stored and poorly managed. This hinders knowledge capitalization, as well as the integration of the value chain network. Alberta’s construction industry hasn’t adopted lean management tools yet, and no common key performance indicators ({KPIs}) are established. Case studies are completed to implement {VSM} in procurement case studies. The results show traditional {VSM} can efficiently identify wastes in the current state of repetitive construction processes and eliminate them in future ones. The study proposed a new {VSM} framework for non-repetitive processes, which is more suitable for onsite construction activities. The framework is implemented in case studies. The results show significant improvements in terms of reducing wastes and the project’s lead time. The construction industry lacks standard methodology for ontology development. The ontologies that have been developed in construction have a deficiency in a philosophical basis and built for a specific use, and for certain project types and phases. To support knowledge management, which can facilitate information flow in the construction supply chain, an ontology for construction knowledge is developed using the Basic Formal Ontology ({BFO}) structure, {ISO} 12006-2 recommendations, and input from industry experts. {BFO} is a mature upper ontology. It provides a framework to build a complete ontology based on philosophical basis. An ontology for the {VSM} framework is also developed using the {BFO} structure, so it can be integrated with the construction knowledge ontology. The developed frameworks can also support the industry’s current efforts to promote more collaborative project delivery approaches},

Ontologies provide a precisely defined vocabulary to build a common and shared conceptualisation of the energy domain. Here, we present the Open Energy Ontology ({OEO}) developed for the domain of energy systems analysis. Using the {OEO} provides several benefits for the community. First, it enables consistent annotation of large amounts of data from various research projects. One example is the Open Energy Platform ({OEP}). Adding such annotations makes data semantically searchable, exchangeable, re-usable and interoperable. Second, computational model coupling becomes much easier. The advantages of using an ontology such as the {OEO} are demonstrated with three use cases: data representation, data annotation and interface homogenisation.

Support for relevant standards in the {AEC} domain - Firstly, {DiCon} ontologies are aligned with {ifcOWL} (the ontology version of the Industry Foundation Classes - standardized as {ISO} 16739) which means that the other relevant information - for instance, about stakeholders, activities, information entities, or sensor observations - can be associated with building objects and spacial entities directly exported from {BIM} tools. Secondly, {DiCon} provides a formalization of the central concepts of {ISO} 19650 that specifies the principles of information management in {BIM}-based projects. The definitions range from built assets, appointments and project teams to information models consisting of a federation of information containers. Thirdly, the information-related concepts of {DiCon} are compatible with the Container ontology of {ISO} 21597 Information Container for Linked Document Delivery that enables the exchange of packages of interlinked datasets across parties.


Fundamental categories based on a top-level ontology - Since {DiCon} covers a wide range of concepts – physical entities, spatial entities, information entities, events, processes, properties, roles, capabilities, etc. – there is a need for generalized concepts or higher-level categories as one method to interrelate different domains of information. Instead of ad hoc generalizations, a standard and widely-used top-level ontology Basic Formal Ontology ({ISO}/{IEC} 21838) is used as the source of fundamental categories. The secondary aim is to advance compatibility with major ontology efforts aligned with {BFO} such as Industrial Ontologies, European Materials Modeling Ontology, and Open Energy Ontology. {BFO} is based on ontological realism - according to which ontology represents entities in the world - that better promotes interoperability than ontologies that allow cultural or mental concepts with more diverse interpretations. The key areas where {DiCon} differs from {BFO} are the representations for artifacts and properties.


Support for the evolution of information - Information will be accumulated, refined, and changed during the execution of construction and renovation projects. {DiCon} supports the evolution of information with two different mechanisms. Firstly, objectification of properties – aligned with {SOSA}/{SSN}, Saref Core, {QUDT} and the {RDF} reification terminology – is used for the small-scale evolution, e.g., for values changing over time as a result of sensor observations. Objectification also enables the representation of other metadata about properties: quantity kinds, units of measure, and property definition entities. Secondly, the large-scale evolution is based on the named graphs of an {RDF} Dataset that are used to implement the {ISO} 19650 information containers. This enables the storage and management of alternative renovation scenarios, different {LOD} levels of {BIM} models, versions of operational plans, entity organizations such as breakdown structures, and so on.


Multiple identifiers and classifications - All {DiCon} entities can be labeled with identifiers and classifications (inspired by the gist ontology). According to the Linked Data principles, every independent entity has a {URI} as its main and retrievable identifier. However, an entity can have additional identifiers in different information systems and other scopes. Identifiers can be globally unambiguous such as a {GUID}, or locally unambiquous, such as a room number in a building (where the building defines the scope of the identifier). Likewise, since different classification systems in the construction sector are used in different geographical regions and organizations, {DiCon} supports the flexible labeling of entities with categories based on the needs of a project. The goal of {DiCon} is to avoid duplicating information that is already in classification systems; after all, classifications are complementary to ontologies in the sense that they capture the variety in the domain with an extensive set of detailed classes (possibly with class-specific attributes), while ontologies represent the complexity in it with a compact set of classes, each with a distinct set of relations to other classes.

	abstract = {With ongoing advancements in information and communication technologies ({ICTs}) in all stages of the construction lifecycle, information from entities related to construction workflow ({CW}) can now be automatically collected. These implementations are point solutions, which require systematic integration to combine their information to enable a holistic picture of {CW}. The major barrier to such integration is information heterogeneity, where the information is collected from different systems under multiple contexts. Scholars in the construction domain have explored the use of ontology to solve the information-integration problem, although an ontology that both adequately represents the {CW} and integrates the digitalized information of {CW} via various systems and multiple contexts is currently missing from the existing literature. This research thus presents an ontology set for formalizing and integrating {CW} information within the digital construction context. The proposed digital construction ontologies ({DiCon}) are shared representations of construction domain knowledge that specify the terms and relations of {CWs} and their related information. We developed the {DiCon} based on a hybrid ontology development approach. The {DiCon} includes six modules: Entities, Processes, Information, Agents, Variables, and Contexts. The developed {DiCon} was further evaluated by approaches including automatic consistency checking, criteria-based evaluation, expert workshops, and task-based evaluation and involved two use cases by answering relevant competency questions via {SPARQL} queries. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that the {DiCon} ontologies are sufficient to represent domain knowledge and can formalize and integrate {CW} information within the digital construction context.},

It highlights the impacts of using such new tools to fast renovation activities starting from the decision-making and design stages to the construction site management with the possibility to monitor occupants' and owners’ feedback during the realization process. In this process, a framework has been developed and implemented to allow stakeholders involved in a renovation project to efficiently compile, maintain, and add data about (i) building elements, (ii) building services systems, (iii) tenants, operators, and owners of the building, and (iv) current and predicted performance of the building from the various data sources available. The framework applies and specializes the existing practices in the Semantic Web, Linked Data, and ontology domain to the management of renovation projects. It has been designed to be open so that any system which implements the required functions and uses the specified conventions will be able to achieve semantic interoperability with other framework-compliant systems in the renovation domain. Finally, this book represents the validation process of the toolkit that has been held in three demo sites: a social housing building in Italy and two private residential buildings in Poland and Finland. The outcome shows that the toolkit facilitates the renovation process with relevant reductions of time, costs, and energy consumption and that the inhabitants can take advantage of the increase in building performances, quality, and comfort.},

@report{seppanenDigitalizingConstructionWorkflow2021,
	title = {Digitalizing Construction Workflow ({DiCtion}) - final report},
	url = {https://research.aalto.fi/en/publications/digitalizing-construction-workflow-diction-final-report},
	abstract = {The project was funded by Business Finland and a consortium of 7 companies: Fira, Trimble, Bonava, Consolis, Parma, Ruukki, Sweco.

Construction industry is suffering from low productivity, high risk of delays and cost overruns.
Globally, productivity growth in construction has averaged only 1 percent a year over the past
two decades, compared with the growth of 2.8 percent for the total world economy and 3.6
percent in manufacturing. At least 20\% of the total construction volume is waste, 30\% of con-
struction is rework, 40\% of jobsite work is unproductive, 40\% of projects are over budget, and
90\% of projects are late (c.f. Forbes \& Ahmed, 2011). Typically this is blamed on the seemingly
complex and chaotic nature of construction production. Complexity arises from the fact that
currently no one has an accurate picture of what has happened and what is happening now, and
there is a very unclear picture of what is going to happen in the future. The vision of the {DiCtion}
project was to solve these problems by digitalizing construction workflows; All construction
project stakeholders should have a shared understanding of past, current and future situation
picture.
The {DiCtion} project investigated various ways to achieve the shared situation picture. A key
challenge that we explored was that different project stakeholders have their own view of the
construction schedule because they are thinking in terms of their own work. In earlier attempts
to resolve this, rigid approaches have been implemented, for example by forcing everyone to
follow the same breakdown of work and locations. However, this rigid breakdown does not work
well for any one of the parties and results in difficulties in updating information or adapting to
changes. Our goal was to allow freedom of action for each stakeholder and to be able to combine
the freely generated information into one, shared, project situation picture to enable collabora-
tive planning. This required research and development related to developing underlying data
models, creating the rules necessary for integrating information on a construction project level,
enabling freedom and collaboration in planning future work, and finally finding out in real time
what has happened before.},

However, there still exists semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts, hindering the exploitation of {ARC}. Thus, a knowledge-informed framework for improved {ARC} is proposed based on natural language processing. Within the framework, an ontology is first established to represent domain knowledge, including concepts, synonyms, relationships, constraints, etc. Then, semantic alignment and conflict resolution are introduced to enhance the rule interpretation process based on predefined domain knowledge and unsupervised learning techniques. Finally, an algorithm is developed to identify the proper {SPARQL} function for each rule, and then to generate {SPARQL}-based queries for model checking purposes, thereby making it possible to interpret complex rules where extra implicit data needs to be inferred. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods successfully filled the semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts with domain knowledge, which achieves a 90.1\% accuracy and substantially outperforms the commonly used keyword matching method. In addition, the proposed rule interpretation method proves to be 5 times faster than the manual interpretation by domain experts. This research contributes to the body of knowledge of a novel framework and the corresponding methods to enhance automated rule checking with domain knowledge.},

However, the subject is very complex and many aspects are usually tackled separately, making it very hard for traditional literature reviews to grasp the actual progress in the overall topic. This paper unveils the detailed state of the art in Digital Building Permitting ({DBP}) by critically analysing the literature by means of a set of coding tags (research progress, implementation, affected {DBP} workflow steps, ambitions addressed) assigned by a multidisciplinary team. The executed research shows that the mainly addressed aspects of the digitalization of building permit process are the technologies to check the compliance of design proposals against regulations, followed by the digitalization of regulations. Improvable aspects identified in the entire building permit system are instead e.g. the involvement of officers, scalability of solutions and interoperability of data, intended both as data validation and as integration of geospatial data with building models. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Municipalities invest a lot of time and person-hours into manual building permit checks. With the increase in computational power and the use of Building Information Models ({BIM}) in the building design life cycle, several municipalities are investing in automating these checks using {BIM} and geo-data sets. However, few examples exist of tools effectively using geo-information with {BIM}. In order to address this gap, a project was developed with the municipality of Rotterdam ({NL}). In a previous phase, a tool was implemented, able to analyse the {BIM} data to extract the needed information for a few representative regulations. In order to extend and improve the previously developed tool, a web-based interface is now implemented and geo-data sets are integrated to the process allowing more powerful {GeoBIM} analysis. Three checks using both {BIM} and {GIS} data were implemented and tested: (i) The parcel limit check evaluates if the building's footprint derived from {BIM} falls within the parcel limit provided from the municipalities' parcel data sets. (ii) The height check evaluates the maximum building's relative height to the road's height. Finally, (iii) the road overhang check detects neighbouring roads to the parcel and evaluates the admissible overhang over that road. This paper presents these developments, including the type of input data that is needed for the checks, the tools for the three new {GeoBIM} checks (parcel limit check, height check, road overhang check) and the implementation in the web-based tool. © 2022 N.

However, in current practice, the building permit issuing as well as the integration of geoinformation with {BIM} ({GeoBIM}) suffers from a number of complex sub-issues. These issues still remain and prevent the development of successful methodologies. In this paper, the building permit use case is explored within a project in close collaboration with the municipality of Rotterdam. A very specific case study in Rotterdam was selected as a starting point, which allowed us to develop the needed methodology for the implementation of an effective tool. In this paper we highlight the interpretation and formalization of regulation for building height, overhang and tower ratio. While these rules are specific to a zoning plan in Rotterdam, we believe that the methodology and encountered issues in formalizing the rules, applying the rules on delivered models and integrating various data sources ({BIM} and {GIS} specifically) are general to most building codes.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The trend of increased usage of both {BIM} and 3D {GIS} and the similarity between the two has led to an increase in the overlap between them. A key application of such overlap is providing geospatial context data for {BIM} models through importing 3D {GIS}-data to {BIM} software to help in different design-related issues. However, this is currently difficult because of the lack of support in {BIM} software for the formats and data models of 3D Geo-information. This paper deals with this issue by developing and implementing a methodology to convert the common open 3D city model data model into the most common open {BIM} data format, namely {CityGML} (Gröger et al., 2012) to {IFC} (buildingsmart, 2019b). For the aim of this study, the two standards are divided into 5 comparable subparts: Semantics, Geometry, Geographical coordinates, Topology, and Encoding. The characteristics of each of these subparts are studied and a conversion method is proposed for each of them from the former standard to the latter. This is done by performing a semantic and geometrical mapping between the two standards, converting the georeferencing from global to local, converting the encoding that the two standards use from {XML} to {STEP}, and deciding which topological relations are to be retained. A prototype implementation has been created using Python to combine the above tasks. The work presented in this paper can provide a foundation for future work in converting {CityGML} to {IFC}. It provides an insight into the relationship between the two standards and a methodology for the conversion from one to the other, and the process of developing software to perform such conversion. This is done in a way that can be extended for future specific needs.},

To solve the integration, several issues need to be tackled and solved, i.e., harmonization of features, interoperability, format conversions, integration of procedures. The {GeoBIM} benchmark 2019, funded by {ISPRS} and {EuroSDR}, evaluated the state of implementation of tools addressing some of those issues. In particular, in the part of the benchmark described in this paper, the application of georeferencing to Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) models and making consistent conversions between 3D city models and {BIM} are investigated, considering the {OGC} {CityGML} and {buildingSMART} {IFC} as reference standards. In the benchmark, sample datasets in the two reference standards were provided. External volunteers were asked to describe and test georeferencing procedures for {IFC} models and conversion tools between {CityGML} and {IFC}. From the analysis of the delivered answers and processed datasets, it was possible to notice that while there are tools and procedures available to support georeferencing and data conversion, comprehensive definition of the requirements, clear rules to perform such two tasks, as well as solid technological solutions implementing them, are still lacking in functionalities. Those specific issues can be a sensible starting point for planning the next {GeoBIM} integration agendas.},

The purpose of the checking process is to warn the users for possible failures, as well as to propose them alternative renovation objects that comply with the rules and can be integrated to their designs.

The design rules focus on the most typical elements for renovation in a residential building, covering the building envelope (roof, wall, windows), {HVAC} systems (boiler replacement, wall radiators) and common use elements such as stairs and corridors. The semantics include information on four basic criteria: thermal and acoustic comfort, fire

However, it is limited to axis-aligned bounding box geometry and the adequacy of its rule-sets cannot be guaranteed. This paper solves these drawbacks by (1) devising a new procedure for compiling inference rule sets that are known a priori to be adequate for complete and thorough classification of model objects, and (2) enhancing the operators to compute complex geometry and enable precise topological rule processing. The procedure for compiling adequate rule sets is illustrated using a synthetic concrete highway bridge model. A real-world highway bridge model, with 333 components of 13 different types and compiled from a laser scanned point cloud, is used to validate the approach and test the enhanced {SeeBIM} system. All of the elements are classified correctly, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach to semantic enrichment.},

It consists of a rule-processing engine and allows composition of inference rule-sets that can be tailored for different domains.

Since model-based data exchange gets increasingly adopted by the industry, feasible and more effective methods must be considered to improve data exchange in the future. While the concept of federated model integration and container-based collaboration as demanded by {ISO}19650 is well established and widely adopted, it shows a number of deficiencies, in particular when it comes to consistency preservation across the domain models and the handling of design updates. Current practice relies on the exchange of complete domain models which requires the manual identification of design changes by all other stakeholders. Consistency is checked merely by collision detection, which however can cover only geometric aspects. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a comprehensive system architecture as well as techniques to identify updates in models and federate such update information by means of update patches. To this end, specific focus is put on possible mechanisms to detect changes and to integrate update patches in the receiving application.},

	abstract = {Model checking is an important task in the {BIM} collaboration process to prevent expensive planning errors. The submodels of the individual disciplines are transferred into a coordination model. Part of the transfer is a conversion into an exchange format. The exchange format allows the import into the model checking application. In the model checking application routines are performed to check the model against collisions and building regulation violations. During the transfer into the exchange format, information may get lost, especially with parameters that are not yet part of the exchange format supported by the authoring software. In recent years, ontologies have been investigated as a feasible approach to combine the submodels, since they model data in a flexible manner. Hence in the conversion process to an application-specific ontology, the data structure of the submodels can widely persist, which could lead to smaller information loss in comparison to converting the data into a standardized exchange format. The evaluation of the geometric properties of the building is indispensable for detecting and analyzing collisions. The basis for the connection of the different sub models could be the {BOT} (Building Topology Ontology), which defines the topological structure of a building and can be used to represent further building information by linking it with other ontologies. The relevant geometric relationships for the collision model checks have to be derived with a geometry kernel. For the research in this paper {pythonOCC}, a wrapper for the geometry kernel Open {CASCADE} is used with the Semantic Web's own query language {SPARQL}, queries can be formulated to analyze the collision relationships in combination with other semantic information. These queries can be used to verify model correctness. By connecting the information from different domains, more sophisticated tests are possible than in an exchange format dependent model checking application. The goal is to integrate the developed functionalities into a project platform. This platform is based on an extensive project description in an ontology-based data model and is connected to different authoring tools for the exchange of information.},

We analyse the potential of Semantic Web query languages to facilitate interoperability.
We propose a classification of mapping patterns that can be applied in data transformations.
We discuss how the mappings can be combined to create different types of queries to cover the most general cases.
We propose their implementation through two different alternatives: {SPARQL}-Generate and {SPARQL} Construct queries.
We evaluate the implementation of each alternative in a case study where {BIM} models are transformed into {SimModel}.

	abstract = {Geometric data plays a central role in the geospatial domain, architectural design and construction industry. For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}), {CityGML}, {GeoSPARQL}, and the {OntoBREP} and {GEOM} ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective challenges.},

	abstract = {At present, the capability to collect information from different sources [building information modeling ({BIM}), sensors, assets database] for asset management ({AM}) use has generated significant opportunities for asset owners and facility managers. {BIM}, in particular, is considered as a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data integration in a {BIM} environment has issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the {AM} processes. This research explored the asset owner requirements from {BIM} in the operation and maintenance stage from an {AM} perspective. The research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the nongeometric {BIM} data required for {AM} and develop a relevant taxonomy; and second, to develop an application programming interface ({API}) plug-in for Autodesk Revit to implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of this study, a critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and focus group interviews with {BIM} and facilities management ({FM}) experts were conducted. The main output was a 60-parameter asset-consuming energy information management ({ACE}-{IM}) taxonomy and the relevant {API} plug-in that can help {BIM} professionals to identify the required data to be submitted to facility managers to improve {AM} processes.},

	abstract = {In the past, building information modeling ({BIM}) in general and building performance simulation ({BPS}) in particular have developed and deployed fairly detailed representations of building geometry, fabric, construction, and technology. Relatively less attention has been paid to the representations of building users. Thereby, one of the key challenges concerns the matching between the nature and level of building-related performance queries on the one hand and the required or appropriate resolution of applied occupant models. This paper addressed this challenge via a two-fold path: A “top-down” path examines the ontological scope of comprehensive, theory-driven representations of building occupants. Such representations could be presumably condensed so as to match the informational requirements of specific performance queries. On the other hand, a “bottom-up” path involves the reverse-engineering of typical building performance simulation tools, focusing thereby on the implicit schema rooted in the tool's input modalities vis-à-vis occupant information. The top-down path can inform the definition of a common schema for occupant-related information. The bottom-up reverse-engineering can provide a reality check in view of the ontological depth of common occupant representations in analysis tools. The pursuit of these paths is suggested to highlight a gap between behavioral domain knowledge and default occupant representation in {BIM} and the analysis of this gap can facilitate the derivation of related ontologies.},

Efficiently utilized, this data could not only enhance the quality and effectiveness of buildings’ operational regimes, but also enrich the knowledge base for building design decision support. However, to exploit the potential of this data effectively, seamless data transformation processes are needed, starting from raw monitoring data and ending in adequately structured and visualized building performance data. In the present contribution, we provide a detailed blueprint of a well-defined and ontologically supported instance of such a transformation process. To illustrate this process, we focus in this paper on a specific class of building performance queries that require information on buildings’ visually relevant boundary conditions. Such queries pertain to, for example, the intensity of incident solar radiation of buildings’ envelope components, the daylight availability and 114distribution in interior spaces, and the expected output of building-integrated solar energy harvesting systems.},

Moreover, assessing compliance, to any degree, in the absence of complete information about a building, down to the smallest detail, is very limited in a purely deductive setting in which nothing can be assumed.

	abstract = {Buildings play an important role in implementing energy efficiency at the urban level.
Since new buildings account just for 1\% of the stock, the largest opportunity comes from the
renovation of existing buildings. While installation and commissioning procedures for energy
efficiency elements in new buildings may be well established, renovation projects address specific
challenges. Main particularities are related to unknowns in pre-existing conditions, presence of
occupants, and space/time limitations. This paper presents an ontology mapping the knowledge
regarding the installation procedures of renovation elements and their constraints. The Reno-Inst
ontology may contribute to developing a shared understanding of this domain and enable easier
information processing, reuse and retrieval in renovation projects. The ontology development relies
on literature review, catalogues, guidelines, and input from experts, focusing on windows, thermal
insulation panels, and heat radiators, three common elements of renovation projects.},

	abstract = {Germany invests more than 12 billion Euros in the rail infrastructure in 2020. Beside
others, bridges and stations have to be rehabilitated. Several inspections and maintenance actions
take place within these processes during which different actors collect, digitize and exchange bridge
and damage information. Currently, inspection and maintenance practice relies on paper based data
collection and exchange, which is time consuming and error prone. A way of storing and exchanging
damage data in a digital format would lower the costs as well as support future needs, e.g. automated
maintenance planning, structural integrity analysis and mixed reality inspections. A majority of
damages are physical damages, like cracks and spalling. This paper presents two different
approaches to model physical damages using the Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}). Finally, the
modelling concepts are tested with multiple {BIM} applications. Although the tests show that {IFC} is
capable of modeling physical damages, current software tools do not support {IFC} up to its full
potential.},

formalization of rules in plain-test human-readable scenarios provides a basis for collaborative
formalization of rules among stakeholders. At the same time our approach includes imperative
program code that is fully extensible to incorporate for example external data sources and
geometrical reasoning. Runnings test on every model revision (the {CI} concept) as opposed to, for
example, upon model delivery ensures a proactive approach to compliance. Reusing existing open
source frameworks allowed us to build a comprehensive solution for continuous and automated
model checking, visualization and reporting in several hundred lines of program code.},

overcome interoperability difficulties, open and application-independent data formats are necessary
and the communication between software applications needs to be standardized. For the first aspect,
the current research project {SCOPE} investigates the extent to which Semantic Web can be used as
an alternative to conventional approaches. The ontologies developed and applied in the research
project focus on geometry descriptions, the linking of geometric and non-geometric contents and
the abstract description of building products. The second, overarching aspect is addressed by
defining an underlying architecture. Hence, a microservice structure is proposed that allows the data
to be extended and enriched with the help of the aforementioned ontologies.},

	abstract = {With the rapid popularity of Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) technology, {BIM} resources such as building product libraries are growing rapidly on the World Wide Web. As a result, this also increases the difficulty for quickly finding useful {BIM} resources that are sufficiently close to user's specific needs. Keyword-based search methods have been widely used due to their ease of use, but their search accuracy is often not satisfactory because of the semantic ambiguity of terminologies in {BIM}-specific documents and queries. To address this issue, we develop a prototype semantic search engine, named {BIMSeek}, for retrieving online {BIM} resources. The central work consists of two parts as follows. Firstly, based on Industry Foundation Classes ({IFC}) which is a major standard for {BIM}, a domain ontology is constructed for encoding {BIM}-specific knowledge into the search engine. Using the ontology, term`inologies in {BIM} documents can be disambiguated and indexed. Secondly, by combining the ontology and local context analysis technique, an automatic query expansion method is presented for improving retrieval performance. Compared with traditional keyword-based methods and {WordNet}-based query expansion methods, the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms them. The search engine is available at http://cgcad.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/liuyushen/ifcqe/.},

	title = {An Ontology of the Uses of Building Information Modeling},
	url = {https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/19966},
	abstract = {uilding Information Modeling ({BIM}) does not change the purpose for performing a task related to delivering a facility – only the means by which the purpose is achieved. Currently, no common language exists for the purposes of implementing {BIM}. This lack of a common language makes it challenging to precisely communicate with others the purposes for implementing {BIM}. The goal of this research is to create that common language by developing a {BIM} Use Ontology. A {BIM} Use (Use) is defined as a method of applying Building Information Modeling during a facility's life-cycle to achieve one or more specific objectives. The {BIM} Use Ontology (the Ontology) provides a shared vocabulary that is applied to model (or express) the {BIM} Uses, including the type of objects (or terms), and concepts, properties, and relationships that exist. The methods performed to develop the {BIM} Use Ontology included: 1) defining domain and scope, 2) acquiring domain knowledge, 3) documenting domain terms, 4) integrating domain terms, 5) evaluating (refining and validating) the {BIM} Use Ontology, and 6) documenting the {BIM} Use Ontology. Overall, the {BIM} Use Ontology classified over 550 {BIM} terms into a defined ontological structure. Before the {BIM} Use Ontology was finalized, this structure was validated through competency questions, term mapping, industry interviews, and focus group meetings. The research methodology implemented to develop the {BIM} Use Ontology was designed based on the following criteria: clarity, comprehensiveness, extendibility, minimal bias, and minimal ontological commitment. The {BIM} Use Ontology primarily classifies the {BIM} Uses based on the purpose of implementing {BIM} on a facility or within an organization; and secondarily classifies {BIM} Uses based on characteristics of the {BIM} Use. The {BIM} Use Ontology classifies {BIM} Uses into five primary {BIM} Use Purposes: 1) Gather, 2) Generate, 3) Analyze, 4) Communicate, and 5) Realize. After the {BIM} Use Purpose is determined, an implementer can identify more detailed {BIM} Use Characteristics such as facility element, facility phase, author discipline, or level of development. Depending upon a particular implementation of {BIM}, the process, information, infrastructure, maturity, benefits, and references are determined. The characteristics make the {BIM} Use Ontology applicable and usable by industry. The {BIM} Use Ontology provides a structure for the purposes by which {BIM} can be implemented during the life-cycle of a facility. The {BIM} Use Ontology provides the fundamental terminology and organizational structure for the purposes for which {BIM} is implemented throughout the life-cycle of a facility. The {BIM} Use Ontology can be applied within procurement language and {BIM} planning to define exact requirements of various parties. The {BIM} Use Ontology can also be applied to standardize process and information exchanges. This standardization is critical to the U.S. National {BIM} Standard. Overall, the {BIM} Use Ontology allows for better communication of the purposes for implementing Building Information Modeling throughout the life of a facility.},

Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) offers a novel approach to design, construction, and facility management in which a digital representation of the building product and process is used to facilitate the exchange and interoperability of information in digital format. {BIM} is beginning to change the way buildings look, the way they function, and the ways in which they are designed and built.

The {BIM} Handbook, Third Edition provides an in-depth understanding of {BIM} technologies, the business and organizational issues associated with its implementation, and the profound advantages that effective use of {BIM} can provide to all members of a project team. Updates to this edition include:

Information on the ways in which professionals should use {BIM} to gain maximum value
New topics such as collaborative working, national and major construction clients, {BIM} standards and guides
A discussion on how various professional roles have expanded through the widespread use and the new avenues of {BIM} practices and services
A wealth of new case studies that clearly illustrate exactly how {BIM} is applied in a wide variety of conditions
Painting a colorful and thorough picture of the state of the art in building information modeling, the {BIM} Handbook, Third Edition guides readers to successful implementations, helping them to avoid needless frustration and costs and take full advantage of this paradigm-shifting approach to construct better buildings that consume fewer materials and require less time, labor, and capital resources.},

	title = {Nordic Study of Classification Systems for Infrastructure \& Transportation: Practical Requirements for Classification of Information in Digital Engineering \& {BIM}},
	url = {https://www.buildingsmart.org/nordic-study-of-classification-systems-for-infrastructure-transportation/},
	abstract = {The report investigates the current state of classification for the built infrastructure environment, while acknowledging that present tools and systems need to recognise the rapid move towards a full digital description of assets and there their functions. It examines criteria for transition and future classification systems. In addition the report looks towards fully information modelled outputs and linked information, which create a ‘Smart Infrastructure’ world.

Summary of conclusions drawn in this report: 
- Classification allows us to understand and identify object types and the properties associated with them.
- There are a number of critical criteria that should characterise choice of classification tools identified and laid out in the report.
- Most current classification systems are still evolving and developing and hence do not meet all future and present requirements. All require further development to fill the current gaps in their implementation.in
- There is a danger of trying to force fit {BIM} requirements into classification systems that were designed for the analogue era rather than evolving them for the digital engineering future.
- The industry is in a transition phase moving from analogue information capture and distribution to a fully digital one.
- The tools we chose during this migration phase must support both but lead us towards fully digital as soon as possible.
- There is no specific Classification system that can be recommended however the features and aims of {CCS} \& {CoClass} which combine the requirements of current facet and enumerated standards plus uses reference designation approach defining relationships and aims culminate in asset delivery comes closest to meeting the criteria. However, it is recognised that there are some issues relating to the use of function as a main sub-divider which need to be resolved.
- Although classification is often used to generate intelligent name labels for objects and features in {CAD} and {BIM} Models this should be regarded as a transitionary process used whilst users still rely on design current design tools.
- The question of the difference between a Project Information Model ({PIM}) and an asset Information Model ({AIM}) is redundant.  Information about an asset is created at the start of a project and evolves through the life cycle, which includes planning and delivery projects to become the complete asset information. In other words, information through life cycle is progressive. The only difference would be the during the design and construction stages contractual and progress information would be attached to the asset under development.
- A rigid hierarchical view of classification should be avoided in future classification but rather a more recursive hierarchy be adopted.
- There should be an effort to simplify classification.
- Future digital engineering should look to identifying an object type, instantiating it with a unique reference and linking it to properties that define that instantiated object rather than cross referring to multiple complex tables. In other words, simplifying identity rather than adding complexity by including in a string of constructs from many tables.
- The use of object types with related properties associated with classification has potential to simplify what has become a very complex subject.
- The existing systems have much information that could be used as a basis to build object type libraries.
- It is suggested that development of Nordic Object Type Libraries would bring together many of the current disparate approaches.
- Whilst the object type library and semantically linked information approach to identifying and relating information is in its relative infancy there is little doubt that it provides a good solution to the industry’s needs in the medium to long term.
- Although the industry is not yet fully prepared for a linked data approach we should endeavour to prepare for it by incorporating it into our standards and make it our direction of travel.},

	abstract = {Buildings tend to not operate as intended, and a pronounced gap often exists between measured and predicted environmental and energy performance. Although the causes of this ‘performance gap’ are multi-faceted, issues surrounding data integration are key contributory factors. The distributed nature of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction ({AEC}) industry presents many challenges to the effective capture, integration and assessment of building performance data. Not all building data can be described semantically, nor is it feasible to create adapters between many different software tools. Similarly, not all building contextual data can easily be captured in a single product-centric model. This paper presents a new solution to the problem based upon a hybrid architecture that links data which is retained in its original format. The architecture links existing and efficient relational databases storing time-series data and semantically-described building contextual data. The main contribution of this work is an original {RDF} syntax structure and ontology to represent existing database schema information, and a new mechanism that automatically prepares data streams for processing by rule-based performance definitions. Two test cases evaluate the concept by 1) applying the hybrid architecture to building performance data from an actual building, and 2) evaluating the efficiency of the architecture against a purely {RDF}-based solution that also stores all of the time-series data in {RDF} for a virtual building. The hybrid architecture also avoids the duplication of time-series data and overcomes some of the differences found in database schemas and database platforms.},

It is based on the hypotheses that there is a need of automation which will improve quality; a need of a means to achieve automation and a need for understanding in industry. After investigation of quality in design, this paper poses three questions; first can a quality system be applied to automatic checking in design; second if the potential for rule-based checking is understood and utilised could quality be assured; and third can we identify the optimal balance between manual and automatic checking. Conclusion shows that {AEC} professionals have low confidence in the quality of design data; the current balance is heavily in favour of manual checking; and while the potential for automatic checking is known, its current utilisation is lacking, due to complexity, poor software support and lack of training.

	abstract = {Rule checking for building designs has been universally acknowledged to have the tremendous potential to improve the quality and safety of buildings. Traditionally, it is viewed as a tool to assist the building code checking process. With the advances in {BIM} and its broad adoption in the past years, it is assumed that we are closer to the realization of an automated rule checking system for building designs with {BIM} as the enabler. {BIM} has brought us the integration of building information and its 3D intelligent objects into building models. It has bridged the gap between the theory, proposed in the 1970s, and the practice. With it, it is viewed that the task to develop an automated rule checking system becomes easier. However, despite many years of research and development in this area, we have not seen the progress we hoped to see. There is only one commercial application available today that is considered successful, i.e. Solibri model checker ({SMC}), and one turnkey implementation at the national level with {CORENET} {ePlanCheck} in Singapore. Even then, they have not really reached their full potential. Various research efforts have tried to address this issue. They focus on different aspects of the issues of rule checking. Some progress has been made, but the challenges stubbornly remain. In fact, the challenges actually increase with the rising popularity of {BIM}. No longer is it just about code checking compliance, but it has also widened to include all aspects of the building design, including the quality of building modelling, which is the focus of {SMC}, using {BIM} to improve the overall process of building lifecycles, specific domain best practices, etc. With such a wide range of requirements, an automated rule checking system appears to be still beyond reach.
This research has ambitious goals, and focuses on looking for a holistic solution to the challenges of an automated rule checking system for building designs. This is a response from real world experience in implementing the {CORENET} {ePlanCheck} system and the subsequent development to improve its implementation, along with a fresh approach to the same issue with the rule checking initiative at Autodesk using Navisworks. The experience indicates that it is insufficient to address the issues with piecemeal approaches, solving one part of the issue while leaving the others open. The reason is that rule checking requires an integrated approach. An efficient software tool can only work efficiently in tandem with efficient access to the data. Likewise, the {BIM} data must be accessible for the checking to be performed efficiently, but the schema design needs to match the expectation for rule checking. Additionally, there is great complexity in dealing with 3D geometry and spatial queries that are often inseparable from building rules, and with the enormous variations of the rules. To approach this problem holistically, this research looks at the problem from the macro level and zooms into the micro level in a systematic and integrated manner. At the highest level, rules need to be classified into four different classes of complexity as viewed from their potential implementation. The classification considers major components needed to solve the problem and the high level identification of the algorithms needed. Through this exercise, there is a recognition that the complexity of the rule implementation relates directly to the complexity of the checking requirements and the concept of derived objects that involve higher level semantic concepts. For the higher level classifications, higher level semantics need to be supported typically by some kind of geometry and graph engines. Most rules including building codes can be addressed with support for up to class-3 rules. The increment of complexity between the classes is not linear and the chasm between classes can be wide. The first step of this research involves analyzing how to narrow the chasm and reduce the complexity, so that developing an automated rule checking system will be relatively easy with minimal development effort required, with the exception of very complex rules and those with very specific requirements.
The second step in this research is to analyze various rules and break down their structure into a systematic and computable form. The suitable form of documentation is in a form of knowledge engineering known as the Conceptual Graph ({CG}). Using {CG}, various rules are analyzed and broken down into their basic concepts and the relationship between concepts. The {CG} will force the breakdown of rules into their atomic rules, the most basic form that identifies what really needs to be checked. At the same time {CG} is also very useful in capturing knowledge of the rules that includes entities, properties, their relationship and functions that operate on the entities. This may even include entities at the higher semantic level. The {CG} is an important step in the rule analysis or rule interpretation since if done properly it will remove ambiguity often found in building codes. At the same time the outcome can be mapped directly to the data model needed and the design for computer implementation.
With the knowledge derived from the above two steps of analyses, three major components are identified to provide a backbone for an automated rule checking system that can simplify its implementation and use. All these three components represent the major innovations that this research advances, i.e. the use of a star-like schema to simplify {IFC} data for high performance queries, the approach to use multiple representations for geometry data, and a query-based extensible {BIM} rule language that allows simple to complex rule definitions. There are other minor innovations that this research also produces, i.e. a non-overlapping octree based spatial indexing for efficient spatial operations, and the methodology and format to capture rule requirements using the Conceptual Graph.
The first major component is providing an efficient access to {BIM} data. While the {IFC} schema is good in facilitating data exchange, it is too complex for efficient queries of the data. The inherent tree-like hierarchical structure of the object based model in {IFC} and its select types make it hard to perform quick and dynamic queries. Therefore, this research explores an approach similar to the Data Warehousing concept that transforms building models from the {IFC} schema into a relatively flat, star-like database schema. This one way extract, transform and load ({ETL}) approach provides an optimized way to query the model. It essentially transforms the {BIM} data into a discoverable and query- able database.
As concluded from the analysis of rule complexity, alphanumeric based data in the database is not sufficient to address the most useful rule checking requirements. This leads us to the second component that involves an integrated support for the 3D geometry and spatial operators to the geometry. A similar concept that has been successfully done in the mostly 2D {GIS} domain is adopted and extended for 3D geometry. In this approach both the alphanumeric and the geometry data now reside in the same database and can be queried together using a standard {SQL}. This brings a positive implication that the {BIM} data is now open and accessible provided that the geometry data can also be queried and standard spatial operations can be applied. Efficient queries can be achieved using a 3D spatial indexing based on Octree structure and multiple representations by denormalizing the geometry data into its basic and most often accessed data for rule checking.

Finally, the third major component in the rule checking system is the glue to all the other components and concepts, i.e. a domain specific rule language simply named {BIM} Rule Language ({BIMRL}). {BIMRL} makes use of the query-able {BIM} data in the database that is integrated with the geometry and its basic spatial operators. It takes a form that is identified from the study of the rule structure that follows the form of a triplet statement: {CHECK} – {EVALUATE} – {ACTION}. It is built on top of an {SQL} interface, but it is simplified for a specific purpose: to capture building rules as simply as possible. The goal is to make rule checking to be easy to define and run, even by rule experts who are usually not programmers. The language inherits the power and flexibility of the relational concept that provides simple to complex queries almost always at will. In this way the language will become an analysis tool to be used to perform any type of check on the building model. Recognizing that it is not possible to have a language that can perform all imaginable rules, {BIMRL} is designed to allow for an extension using an evaluation function. The extension will facilitate rule checking that involves operations that are harder to perform or for specialized checking requirements and add them as component plug-ins to {BIMRL}. They can take advantage of the query capability and rule structure in {BIMRL} without changing the structure of the language itself.

A software prototype has been developed as a proof that the concept is able to solve the problem of rule checking, which is what this research really aims to solve. The prototype involves the following capabilities:
1. The ability to query and check the building model without expensive and heavy technical or programming requirements.
2. The ability to perform checks on both the properties and geometry of the building model.
3. Flexibility that is built into the language to allow queries with open ended sets
4. The ability to perform class-1 to class-3 rules (at least part of class-3) without additional extensions).

Using the prototype software, this thesis demonstrates how effective the approach is when it is applied to real-world building models (which includes the typical architectural, structural and {MEP} elements) using several representative rules. This prototype covers all the aspects discussed in this research, i.e. the database star-like schema, its {ETL}, 3D geometry support and its spatial indexing, the associated multiple representations, graph support in the database, and the {BIMRL} language parser and simple user interface with support for visual reporting using an open standard X3D format.

This research demonstrates that the holistic approach to the automated building rule checking problem takes it closer to realizing the true potential of rule checking systems. The author believes that it can even serve as an analysis tool to provide a decision support system regarding {BIM}. With its accessibility by rule experts or even modelers, {BIMRL} opens up a lot more avenues for research and uses of rule checking and analysis on {BIM} data.},

	abstract = {Building automation ({BA}) systems ensure comfort and safety of the occupants while optimizing energy consumption. Malfunctions of electro-mechanical equipment or the associated control function result not only in incorrect operation, but also wastage of energy. Automated fault detection and diagnostics ({AFDD}) of processes like heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) is a challenging task due to the diversity of the applications and inter-dependencies between the equipment. Semantic description of the building and its equipment can help {AFDD} agents to better understand the system and continuously examine its operation. However, {AFDD} using only the structural description of the building topology and the contained equipment without relating it to the control functions requires manual verification of the root cause. In this work, we added a model of the control functionality to the semantic information of the structural and topological description and represented it using W3C Web of Things Thing Descriptions. Based on these descriptions, we have demonstrated in a case study of a building installation that fault detection rules which have access to the semantic description of underlying control functions can be formulated more precisely and thereby avoid false positives.},

This is achieved through the processing of data points collected from sensors and the control of installed actuators, and increasingly incorporates machine learning components. However, engineering of {BA} systems is intricately linked with the planning, installation, (pre-)commissioning, and operation of building services such as {HVAC}, and it requires an extensive amount of manual coordination which is often prone to errors, many of which are only detected late in the lifecycle and tends to lose transparency in data provenance. To address this, we propose the application of {DevOps}, a highly successful paradigm in the field of software engineering, to {BA} engineering process coordination. In addition, the possibility of using semantic data to develop artifacts such as requirements, construction, and devices of {BA} systems opens up the avenue of achieving continuous verification of the system as it is built and commissioned. Concretely, we propose a novel approach that integrates a semantic reasoner using the machine-understandable data of the building along with interactions facilitated by Web of Thing Thing Description to the {DevOps} workflow. The proposed approach is expected to ameliorate limitations of existing workflow management methods and thus provide transparency in the data provenance to gain trust for data-driven {AI} applications for {BA}.},

The devices used in Building Automation ({BA}) systems have different functional and non-functional requirements, and this leads to a heterogeneous system with vertical silos where multiple standards are at play along with vendor-specific information models and implementations. In such a situation establishing technical and semantic interoperability is challenging. Also, the absence of a method to uniformly represent entities across verticals and functional layers in {BA}, makes it difficult to link them to knowledge graphs that describe the building and its physical processes. The W3C Web of Things ({WoT}) aims to address this (and related) issues in cyber-physical systems ({CPS}). Based on our experience with a real-life implementation in the industry, we demonstrate how the challenge of creating uniform interface descriptions for the vast and heterogeneous {BA} standards landscape can be be overcome using {WoT} Thing Descriptions ({TDs}), and further, we show how such {TDs} can be linked to knowledge graphs by facilitating their integration in the engineering workflow. As a concrete use case, our demo shows how an automated fault detection system which we developed for room automation controls uses the {TDs} to reason about the physical process and its control programs and then retrieves process data for its analysis.},

	abstract = {In the Architecture Engineering and Construction ({AEC}) industry, Building Information Model ({BIM}) authoring tools enable the creation of digital representations of buildings. Each tool implements its own building data model, which makes it difficult to achieve the desired interoperability when building data have to be exchanged with other software (e.g., building energy simulation tools). The representation of {BIM} models through open standards (e.g., {IFC}) and Semantic Web technologies can facilitate building data transformation in an automated and flexible way. This is achieved by taking advantage of the logical basis of the Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) data model and queries created in the Semantic Web query languages. The result is a pragmatic mechanism to transform the data from one data domain to another. This article analyses the potential of Semantic Web query languages to facilitate the data transformation of building data through different alternatives. The first contribution is the identification of fourteen data mapping patterns and three cases of data transformation that enable transforming one data model into another, considering the semantic and structural differences between them. The second contribution is the review and comparison of query languages to carry out the transformations through two different alternatives: using {SPARQL}-Generate and {SPARQL} Construct queries. And finally, the third contribution is the definition of a metric to assess the complexity of {SPARQL} queries.},

	abstract = {Ontologies have been great resources to share and exchange domain knowledge in the context of {BIM}. Ontologies define the logic and semantics needed for {BIM} applications by formally classifying entities in the domain including the types, properties, relationships and other significant attributes. One major benefit of using ontologies is that the information and knowledge defined with these ontologies can be shared across the various {BIM} applications without divulging proprietary information. However, major challenges exist with sharing and reuse of information due to the lack of consistency, redundancy, and potential errors. This chapter explores the development of ontologies, languages, and standards to highlight the applications and deployments of shared representations of building information models. The objectives include: 1) present an overview of knowledge management in a {BIM} context, including the status of available standards and data exchange approaches; 2) explain the details of ontology components and the Semantic Web stack, 3) discuss the development, reusage, and management of ontologies; 4) present current {AEC} ontologies that can be integrated with {BIM} be discussed; and 5) reflect on the limitations and open challenges regarding {BIM} and ontologies to promote future research. Major findings highlighted in this chapter include i) perfectly interoperable integrated systems will never be fully achieved since interoperability between systems and data structures always need to be made, in which those mappings always come with ‘interpretation errors’ or ‘data loss’, ii) integrating {BIM} tools with other data sets predominantly including time series databases (sensor data), {GIS} data, and complex 3D data, into a single data storage system is neither efficient nor desirable, and iii) {BIM} and digital twin applications needs support from Semantic Web and linked data. Significantly, recent research and developments suggest that {BIM}, even with current challenges, will expand to utilization that is yet to be envisioned.},

	abstract = {As the mounting demand for building new residential and commercial units strikes the record, significant pressure from stakeholders investing in the construction industry has increasingly been requiring the government authorities to issue the construction permit in a timely manner. However, the architectural and engineering design review process is still mostly a time-consuming manual procedure. It involves assessing a design against codes and standards requirements to validate the accuracy and quality of the design and detecting errors before manufacturing and fabrication commences. Building design provisions are generally in the form of texts, charts, tables, and mathematical expressions. These regulations and guidelines usually have legal status. Thus, the computerization of this process represents a real challenge to the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction ({AEC}) industry. Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) provides a platform for developing a virtual permitting process to improve the efficacy of issuing building permits by the authorities. This chapter reviews recent advancements in virtual permitting using {BIM}. Also, it presents data collected about the construction permitting process from Authority Having Jurisdiction ({AHJ}) plan reviewers, architects, engineers, and general contractors in the state of Florida. The primary goal is to tackle the problem by using the available data and technology to develop a {BIM}-driven Virtual Permitting System ({VPS}) to achieve design accuracy and permitting efficiency. The potential integration of {VPS} with blockchain will be discussed, along with benefits and limitations.},

	abstract = {To fully automate building code compliance checking, regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted and transformed from building codes. Existing regulatory requirement processing efforts mainly focus on building code requirements in text. A more efficient approach for processing regulatory requirements in other parts of building codes, such as tables or charts, remains to be addressed. The ability to process building code requirements in all parts and formats is necessary for an automated code compliance checking system to achieve full coverage of checkable building code requirements. To address this gap, the authors propose a semiautomated information extraction and transformation method. The proposed method can extract building code requirements in tables and convert extracted information to logic rules. Automated code compliance checking systems can utilize the logic rules. The proposed method includes two main steps: (1) tabular information extraction, and (2) rule generation. The tabular information extraction semiautomatically detects the layout of tables, extracts building code requirements from tables, and transforms extracted information to databases. The rule generation step automatically generates logic rules that can be directly executed by logic reasoners. The rule generation step also provides options for users to further refine the generated rules. The development of the tabular information extraction algorithm takes an iterative approach. An experiment was conducted to develop a tabular information extraction algorithm from a section of existing code. The primary version of the algorithm correctly processed 91.67\% of tables in a second sample section. After iterative refinements, the updated tabular information extraction algorithm correctly processed all tables in this section. The rule generation algorithm correctly generated logic rules that successfully represented the applicable building code requirements for a testing building, a convenience store in Texas based on the tabular information.},

The article provides suggestions for further research, and it specifically calls for a more strategic research that can look a bit longer than just the challenges associated with various limited case projects. The article discusses whether existing {BIM} formats are able to meet future requirements, where the potential in the construction industry to fully utilize semantic web technology is difficult with today's {BIM} standards. Furthermore, it is suggested that previously developed {SW} resources should be gathered, then earlier initiatives are easier to find, use and build upon. The literature study shows many initiatives spread across many domains in the {AEC}-{FM} area. Most studied articles have a high degree of technological focus, where the semantic web opportunities are tested in a chosen case.The findings of this study can be used as a starting point for further strategic research and development.},

	abstract = {In {AECO} (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Owner-operated) industry information are mainly defined and exchanged in natural language through textual files and documents. On the contrary, a Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) approach requires machine processable data and information. Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) allows to process textual information into structured format. About {BIM} in {AECO} industry, and {NLP} in different sectors, several literature reviews have been conducted. However, none of them highlighted the possible connections between the two topics. This study provides a scientometric analysis aiming to investigate possible combined applications of {BIM} and {NLP}. A quantitative literature review approach is employed, using data visualization and science mapping applied on bibliometric meta-data. The performed analysis uncovered possible directions for further research on {NLP} and {BIM} combined applications in {AECO} sector. Most active authors, key research patterns, and institutional affiliations are identified. The main applications areas of a combined {NLP} and {BIM} approach in {AECO} are: Information Retrieval and Information Enrichment of {BIM} models, Automatic Compliance Checking, and Safety and Risk Management. The keywords pattern analysis highlighted the main tools which allows to link Semantic {BIM} and {NLP} methods and technologies, i.e. Ontology and Machine Learning algorithms. The scientometric analysis also reveals a gap related to the Preliminary design and Requirement definition phases, highlighting a possible research area not covered by the Academia as of now.},
