        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract In response to the growing concerns about climate change and the environment, sustainable design of buildings is increasingly demanded by building owners and users. However, fast evaluation of various design options and identification of the optimized design requires application of design analysis tools such as energy modeling, daylight simulations, and natural ventilation analysis software. Energy analysis requires access to distributed sources of information such as building element material properties provided by designers, mechanical equipment information provided by equipment manufacturers, weather data provided by weather reporting agencies, and energy cost data from energy providers. Gathering energy related information from different sources and inputting the information to an energy analysis application is a time consuming process. This causes delays and increases the time for comparing different design alternatives. This paper discusses how Semantic Web technology can facilitate information collection from several sources for energy analysis. Semantic Web enables sharing, accessing, and combining information over the Internet in a machine process-able format. This would free building designers to concentrate on building design optimization rather than spending time on data preparation and manual entry into energy analysis applications." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The Industry Foundation Class (IFC) Model implemented by schema and data format definition in EXPRESS\nlanguage is the industry standard for open data modeling and exchange. This data model, based on E-R model\nwith deep object class instance hierarchy for both elements and relationships has presented challenges in\nimplementing scalable database approaches for managing and serving BIM objects while maintaining\nrequisite relationships necessary for inferring relationships across the complex E-R network. Alternative\nmodels based on alternative data encodings with associated data topologies, database strategies and\nsupporting tool sets such IFCXML, IFCJSON and RDF/IFCOWL have been proposed, with associated\naffordances and limitations in terms of semantic richness, validation and querying capability and scalability.\nGraph databases are a recent development in modern databasing technology that is gaining prominence in\nthe broader computing community. Graph databases promise general support of complex entity-relationship\nnetworks in a manner that supports rich semantic inference at scale. Consider those limitations stated above,\nthis paper propose a method of database mapping between IFC Model to Graph database, and presents\nopportunities for drawing on graph querying capabilities to develop inferences about the semantic\nrelationships among objects in IFC BIM models. The implementation and examination of this mapping is\nachieved by translating the IFC data and then store them into Neo4j, a commonly used graph database\napplication. As part of this translation, broadly available IFC to XML conversion utilities were used to\nconvert the BIM software output to XM. A python based parser was developed and used to parse the IFC\ncomponent information and generate a Cypher script - the structural language for graph database\nconstruction.. This Cypher script - encapsulating the IFC E-R model is imported into the Neo4j graph\ndatabase in batches with Neo4j-Shell." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract The capability to accurately detect changes between successive versions of the IFC representation of a BIM model would enable the development of generic change management functionalities for construction projects. Unfortunately, IFC models consist mostly of anonymous objects without stable identities; therefore the computation of differences between versions is complicated. When IFC models are converted into an RDF representation, the uniform graph structure offers new algorithmic opportunities. We study how to assign unique and stable identities to anonymous nodes based on signatures generated from their graph environment, and present the Short Paths Crossings Algorithm (SPCA) that computes sets of paths with limited length from anonymous nodes taking into account their crossings. Empirical tests show that SPCA produces significantly smaller difference sets for IFC-derived graphs than previous algorithms for RDF change detection." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Narrowing the performance deficit between design intent and the real-time environmental and energy performance of buildings is a complex and involved task, impacting on all building stakeholders. Buildings are designed, built and operated with increasingly complex technologies. Throughout their life-cycle, they produce vast quantities of data. However, many commercial buildings do not perform as originally intended. This paper presents a semantic web based approach to the performance gap problem, describing how heterogeneous building data sources can be transformed into semantically enriched information. A performance assessment ontology and performance framework (software tool) are introduced, which use this heterogeneous data as a service for a structured performance analysis. The demonstrator illustrates how heterogeneous data can be published semantically and then interpreted using a life-cycle performance framework approach." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "This report is the result of a review commissioned by the buildingSMART\nInternational Regulatory Room. It explores the emerging future of automated\nrule checking (ARC). ARC is no longer just a “technical tool” needed to spot or\nstudy errors in design or work plans. Increasingly, research and applications of\nARC are going beyond “box-ticking” compliance with regulatory rules. ARC is\nno longer just a cost-saving “software tool”, but a money-making “service or\nproduct”. Consequently, instead of the top-down, expert-system-like format,\nnew forms of ARC are semantic-savvy, and are based on (bottom-up) analytics\nand machine learning approaches. ARC can now be used to automatically\ngenerate the analyses and/or services that consultants or contractors deliver.\nIn fact, it can now (partially) be used to generate the design or work plans\nthemselves.\nThe interest in such types of ARC is a reflection of the growing importance and\nfeasibility of AI (artificial intelligence), not just as an advanced form of\nsophisticated analysis tools, but as a driver for new business. The ability of\nusing advanced AI approaches in these new types of ARC is a key outcome of\nthe maturity of BIM in the industry. Thanks to IFC (Industry Foundation\nClasses), we now have a data-rich environment, where machine learning and\npattern analysis can help us discover and use rules more effectively.\nCompanies that master the inclusion, deployment and marketing of ARC\ncapabilities will be more competitive in the new economy. Consequently, the\n“business value” of ARC is changing. It is poised to be a generator of services/\nproducts not a quality control mechanism. Increasingly, it directly contributes to\nrealizing new segments in the market. This ranges from products for automated\nanalyses (including the automation of designs), to products for customization\nand delivery of information to customers (analysis-on-demand), to enhancing\nreal-time management of sites and facilities (intelligent buildings).\nHowever, ARC value goes beyond the automation of some technical analyses\nwithin a digitized system (making more software more intelligent). More\nimportantly, one of the key values of advanced forms of ARC is its role in\norganizational transformation. The sophisticated considerations and cultural\nchanges needed to develop and deploy an ARC make it an effective linchpin\nfor enterprise-wide AI initiatives. The expertise gained from implementing\nadvanced ARC can be the best testbed for wider reengineering of business\nprocess, automation of workflow, and the deployment of business intelligence\nwithin the firm (or a facility). In other words, the sophistication of ARC\nimplementation will propel the re-making of the firm not just its services. It\nchanges the firm as it changes its offerings.\nTo support better understanding of this new reality, this report aims to frame\nthe business case for ARC, with three main considerations: 1) ARC is a form of\nmachine learning system—it is not limited to an expert system tool; 2) ARC\nincludes checking rule compliance and the generation of rules through data\nanalysis; 3) because of its role in assuring the transformation of enterprises into  the AI-savvy economy, the business case analysis should reflect that. The business case should not be made only based on the interest of a technical team (cost savings through partial automation of some technical processes).\nRather, it is to be made to an executive who is considering the customer needs and service offering and, indeed, the future, structure and strategy of the firm." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract As Building Information Modeling evolves into becoming the central mean for coordinating project design and planning activities, we notice a few limitations/opportunities in the way current BIM tools address the needs for integrated design, collaboration and analysis (the initial objective of BIM). First, substantial communications and interactions about the design exist outside the BIM environment — typically in e-mail formats. This may cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste valuable knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need of engaging end-users and their keen interest in selecting “green” features. Professionals can develop different designs that achieve varying levels of energy conservation, but these will always require changes based on usage patterns. So, it is important that end-users are involved in the design process early on to make sure that they receive adequate information/ education before they make decisions. This is the nature of limitations that we try to address in this research. This paper builds around the design and development of an online system, named Green2.0 that tries to leverage advancements in Building Information Models (BIM), energy-efficiency simulation tools, and online social network analysis methods to enable a data-driven approach to building planning, construction and maintenance. Fundamentally, it allows participants (end-users or professionals) to comment and share views about building designs. Social network analysis and semantic modeling tools are then used to extract information from these interactions. At the same time, it connects BIM to energy analysis software to allow users to select different products from a catalog and assess the impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals, end-users and public policy makers work together throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an open platform, it provides access to information that enables researchers and practitioners to build new, more efficient theories and methods of building design. The premise of our work is that by providing new insights into the building design process it is likely to have a profound beneficial effect for both AEC professionals and the society at large." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Semantic Web technologies are becoming more and more appealing to the community of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) users. The recent actions towards the development of an OWL version of the IFC schema (named ifcOWL) evidence the effort of facing the community request to specify IFC in an ontology language. This paper presents an enrichment of the EXPRESS to OWL conversion patterns with OWL class expressions that specifically capture certain constraints of the IFC standard. The presented class expressions can be used to improve the robustness of ifcOWL and support data integrity, consistency, and applicability across various scenarios of industrial application. In particular, the rules defining the relationships between non-abstract subtypes of IfcObject and corresponding subtypes of IfcTypeObject are analyzed and converted into novel class expressions. The proposed additions to the conversion pattern have been implemented into a software tool and the resulting ontology was tested against a use case to show the benefits of the new solution with respect to a basic ifcOWL. The novel conversion pattern enhances usability of the ifcOWL ontology by enabling its direct instantiation, without necessarily going through the intermediate generation of a STEP physical format that is then converted into an ontology." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The World Wide Web has provided a vast distributed information space that is primarily designed for human consumption. The enmeshment of the Web and various business processes has made it imperative to define business information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception; construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information, it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently, the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) data model. Several researchers have investigated the limitations of IFCs data model for interoperability among heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared building ontology that models building domain element types and element relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element properties to the shared building ontology. SWRL rules are used for mapping element properties from one domain to another. An example demonstrates how the developed approach can facilitate project information sharing between design and estimating domains." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Recent years have witnessed the development of various techniques and tools for the building code-compliance of IFC models. Indeed these are great efforts, but, still there is a gap for the fully automatic building code-compliance. This paper presents our research and development of Semantic BIM Reasoner (SBIM-Reasoner) which employs semantic technologies to meet the requirements of semantic verification of an IFC model. SBIM-Reasoner employs several preprocessors (IFC to RDF converter, Geometry Extractor) to build the semantic repository from the input IFC model. Once all the triples are generated from the initial data (.ifc file), Stardog is used to build a knowledge graph for the semantic verification. All types of inference and reasoning mechanisms for the semantic verification are applied over this knowledge graph to meet the requirements of verification. Knowledge graph over triplets enables freedom of extending RDF based Semantic IFC model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation of newer rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with condition and constraints over IFC data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the initial data of IFC model, etc. Finally, we tested our prototype by using several online IFC models. We conclude that semantic technologies provide more rich mechanisms and answer vast types of queries for the verification of IFC models. It provides powerful features based on SPARQL libraries and serves best for the automated code compliance and verification of IFC models." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Automated rule checking has been identified as potentially providing significant value to the AEC industry from both regulatory and industry perspectives. Key challenges to a successful rule checking implementation are the complexities inherent in the rules themselves and the breadth of conditions to which they need to apply. Due to the large number of building codes and theoretically infinite number of rules that can be defined, it is critical to systematize the rules to make the task of rule checking tractable. This paper is a first step towards classifying automated rule checking. In this paper, the authors draw upon their extensive international exposure with various building codes and rule checking areas in the AEC domain to introduce a general classification of rules across application domains using criteria that apply to all known aspects of automated rule checking. The exposure covers both academic research as well as actual production implementation done with CORENET ePlanCheck project in Singapore, and also various pilot implementations in the US and other countries. The authors offer a survey of representative examples of different classes of rules, their key concepts, potential tools required to implement them, and at least one possible solution of each example rule in each category. The examples are drawn from both research domains and existing commercial applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial guide for creating a framework for rule classification that articulates both the process challenges and the technology needs to address rule automation." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract In the last decade, the paradigm Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM) was investigated to exploit the possibilities offered by the application of BIM to historical buildings. In the Cultural Heritage domain, the BIM-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a workflow that exploits the advantages of BIM platforms and Semantic-Web technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of semantically structured and rich HBIM data. The presented pipeline follows four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and, later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model, providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with appropriate LOD and Grade in BIM environment and then guarantee a complete interoperability with IFC/RDF format. Relying on semantically structured data (ontologies) and on the Linked Data stack appears a valid approach for addressing existing information system issues in the CH domain and constitutes a step forward in the management of repositories and web libraries devoted to historical buildings." ;

                        dcterms:abstract  "Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web technologies are becoming more and more popular in the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) and Facilities Management (FM) industry to support information management, information exchange and data interoperability. One of the key integration gateways between BIM and Semantic Web is represented by the ifcOWL ontology, i.e. the Web Ontology Language (OWL) version of the IFC standard, being one of reference technical standard for AEC/FM. Previous studies have shown how a recommended ifcOWL ontology can be automatically generated by converting the IFC standard from the official EXPRESS schema. However, the resulting ifcOWL is a large monolithic ontology that presents serious limitations for real industrial applications in terms of usability and performance (i.e. querying and reasoning). Possible enhancements to reduce the complexity and the data size consist in (1) modularization of ifcOWL making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology, and (2) rethinking the contents and structure of an ontology for AEC/FM to better fit in the semantic web scope and make its usage more efficient. The second approach can be enabled by the first one, since it would make it easier to replace some of the ifcOWL modules with new optimized ontologies for the AEC-FM industry. This paper focuses on the first approach presenting a method to automatically generate a modular ifcOWL ontology. The method aims at minimizing the dependencies between modules to better exploit the modularization. The results are compared with simpler and more straight-forward solutions." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Complexity of algorithms and policies in energy systems has increased interactions among heterogeneous systems and information sources. Demand Response (DR) is a representative example where electrical grids and buildings communicate with each other to manage overall electricity demands. There are various industry standards that model the information and the interactions between grids and buildings. However, each building has all the burden of converting information from different models to its information model prior to using it. We envision a system-agnostic information model for these interactions that can reduce information conversion to/from buildings and invigorate the interaction. We propose an integration of ontologies and standards to express DR interactions and open the possibility of connecting other information models. We also suggest an information mediator system that interprets and delivers messages among grids and buildings and can mediate energy usage among buildings based on the system-agnostic model." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "In the AEC industry, there is a large number of standards and codes which ensure the structural stability, reliability, usability of the building under design. Accordingly, checking the conformity of the building design with these requirements is a crucial process. Nowadays this checking is performed to a large extent manually based on two-dimensional technical drawings and textual documents. Due to the low level of automation, the conventional checking procedure is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone. As Building Information Modeling (BIM) becomes more and more mature, a suitable digital information basis also becomes available to enable automating the process. The commercial solutions for code compliance checking available so far mainly follow a black-box approach where the rules that make up a certain regulation are implemented in a hard-wired fashion rendering their implementation in-transparent and non-extendable. A number of researchers have tackled this problem and have proposed various ways that allow the user to define rules, either in a standard programming language or in a dedicated language. However, AEC domain experts usually do not have the required programming skills to use these languages appropriately. To overcome this issue, we introduce the Visual Code Checking Language (VCCL), which uses a graphical notation in order to represent the rules of a code in a machine- and human-readable language. The paper presents the features and functionalities of the VCCL in detail and shows its application in a number of case studies." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The recent advances in the automation of metadata normalization and the invention of a unified schema --- Brick --- alleviate the metadata normalization challenge for deploying portable applications across buildings. Yet, the lack of compatibility between existing metadata normalization methods precludes the possibility of comparing and combining them. While generic machine learning (ML) frameworks, such as MLJAR and OpenML, provide versatile interfaces for standard ML problems, they cannot easily accommodate the metadata normalization tasks for buildings due to the heterogeneity in the inference scope, type of data required as input, evaluation metric, and the building-specific human-in-the-loop learning procedure. We propose Plaster, an open and modular framework that incorporates existing advances in building metadata normalization. It provides unified programming interfaces for various types of learning methods for metadata normalization and defines standardized data models for building metadata and timeseries data. Thus, it enables the integration of different methods via a workflow, benchmarking of different methods via unified interfaces, and rapid prototyping of new algorithms. With Plaster, we 1) show three examples of the workflow integration, delivering better performance than individual algorithms, 2) benchmark/analyze five algorithms over five common buildings, and 3) exemplify the process of developing a new algorithm involving time series features. We believe Plaster will facilitate the development of new algorithms and expedite the adoption of standard metadata schema such as Brick, in order to enable seamless smart building applications in the future." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "During the design and construction phases of building projects, domain experts iteratively exchange building information models. One of their goals is to ensure that the requirements and objectives of a proposed project are satisfied. In addition, most building information modeling software currently implements heterogeneous mapping processes in their IFC interfaces that bind their native models to the IFC format. However, such exchanges frequently do not realize intended geometric transformations, project requirements, and required syntactic and semantic conditions in building model data, exacerbating the problem of model integrity and resulting in expensive changes during the construction and operation phases. These problematic issues have been addressed by the development of solid frameworks for validating a building design. This paper surveys six currently available applications for validating building design data and identifies their strengths and weaknesses: The Express Engine's EXPRESSO, the JDSAI™, the EXPRESS Data Manager™, the IFC server ActiveX Component, the IfcDoc, and the Solibri Model Checker®. We also structured the validation processes into three types of tasks: 1) a syntax check of the assurance of compliance with the IFC schema defined by the EXPRESS language, 2) semantic and syntactic assessment in terms of conformity to model view definitions, which consist of concept modularizations, and 3) the validation of design programming requirements that evaluates regulations, project criteria, owner requirements, and functional performance. The purpose of this survey, based on available software that supports the validation of building model data for these three types of interoperability issues, is to integrate diverse checking approaches, as a basis for improving what are now widely distributed efforts." ;

With the creation of complex systems, the need for efficient in­teroperability arises. Based on a study of bim interoperability dimensions and its levels, this research presents an inter­operability assessment of bim system in the structural domain, especially considering cast-in-place concrete structures, since they present some special challenges for system interoperability. This assessment was conducted by experiments that imported and exported structural models and structural elements through a non-proprietarz standard for bim mod­els (ifc- industry foundation classes). The experiments were conducted twice, with a five year gap from each other, so the evolution of the interoperability could be assessed as well. The results showed that some special characteristics must be considered in order to achieve efficient interoperability for cast-in-place concrete structures – these structures are monolithic and they have reinforcement steel bars that need detailing. Also, the research showed that in the five-year gap there were evolutions in interoperability, like in object identifiers, which had a considerable improvement. However, some of the major problems remain, such as overlapping of structural parts." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Construction planning is a fundamental and challenging process in the management and execution of construction projects. The task of developing technical plans is critical to ensuring the success of a construction project. This task of preparing a technical plan is usually undertaken manually using two separate processes: (1) plan definition and (2) verification/checking. This paper introduces an ontological approach to support the plan definition and verification process. Using this approach, the technical plans are modeled into plan ontology in a layered modeling structure. The verification knowledge is modeled into ontology axioms and semantic rules. A case example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach for pit excavation. In addition, the proposed approach enables the compliance verification process to be undertaken in parallel with the technical plan definition. As a result, the plans' compliance can be ensured during the project delivery process. The research provides a novel ontological and semantic mechanism for reusing plans and their automatic verification in construction, which is semantically reasoned." ;

        dcterms:abstract   "Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers the potential to transform our lives in radical ways. However, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even underestimate what various technologies in AI are capable of today. Certainly, the translation from scientific papers and benchmark performance to products is faster in AI than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is often the case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. This document describes an example-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (e.g., maturity and availability levels). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI and identify different categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness-vs-generality charts, where we see that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while low TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields, and show their readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as a base for a broader discussion of AI technologies. Finally, we use the dynamics of several AI technology at different generality levels and moments of time to forecast some short-term and mid-term trends for AI." ;

Compared to existing alignment efforts, which are either manual or semi-automated, the proposed method aims to automate the alignment process for supporting fully automated energy compliance checking. A first-level simple alignment method is proposed to align single design information instances to single regulatory concepts, in which (1) domain knowledge is used for interpreting the meaning of concepts to recognize candidate instances, and (2) deep learning is used for capturing the semantics behind the words to measure semantic similarity and select the matches. A final complex alignment method is proposed to recognize the instance groups belonging to a regulatory requirement, in which (1) supervised and unsupervised searching algorithms are used to identify the instance pairs, and (2) network modeling is used to group and link the instance pairs to the requirement. The proposed method showed 93.4% recall and 94.7% precision on the testing data." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research." ;

The process has two parts: (1) sorting subsets of the reconstruction into classes (semantic segmentation) defined by a BIM taxonomy and (2) identifying geometric parameters describing each class instance. Here we demonstrate the ability of deep learning artificial neural networks to semantically segment images of building facilities. We found this deep learning approach capable of simultaneously recognizing: ceiling, wall, plumbing, duct, door, floor, and stairs classes. This semantic scope surpasses state-of-the-art building system recognition methods and represents progress towards comprehensive BIM creation." ;

The compliance of building designs to fire safety regulations holds an utmost importance to ensure adequate fire safety level in the building. The automation in compliance checking process could save significant time and cost as well as avoid inaccuracies. Since regulations are commonly written in human linguistic format, the semantics of the regulations need to be captured and extracted to translate them into computer interpretable rules. This paper demonstrates the process in capturing the semantics of fire safety regulations in Selangor Uniform Building By-Laws 1984 through the adoption of knowledge formalisation method. A framework was developed to provide a comprehensive guideline in capturing the semantics for the classification of fire safety regulations. The framework affirms the reliability of executing this method for other building regulations. This paper is an ongoing research in developing an automated BIM-based fire regulations compliance checking system in Malaysia, whereby the results attained from this paper will be used to extract the semantics of the regulations to create computer interpretable rules." ;

Due to the high dependencies among the disciplines, this information must be carefully checked. While semi-automatic methods for checking geometric information exist, the validation of semantic information is often done manually and document-based causing errors and an inefficient, laborious collaboration process. In order to create an expert system for BIM-based factory design through automatic checking of semantic information, this paper lays the corresponding foundation regarding (i) domain-specific validation rules and (ii) software implementation possibilities by using a two-round Delphi study." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Building designs in countries such as the United Kingdom are currently checked manually against a frequently changing and increasingly complex set of building regulations. This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for England and Wales." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract Over the recent years, the usage of semantic web technologies has notably increased in the domains of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the AEC domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains. Results show that semantic web technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g. BIM + Infra + GIS + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2) devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures." ;

A previous study proposed a methodology based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Facility Management (FM) systems integration, underpinned by a Performance Information Model, to support the performance assessment and the maintenance management. The purpose of this paper is to extend and validate that methodology with an open standard approach. A subset of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema related to performance assessment and maintenance procedures is mapped into a relational database. The database supports the integration between BIM models and facilities information systems. Case studies including healthcare buildings test the database and a new application. The results contribute to the BIM adoption in the FM domain. Also, the studied and validated IFC schema subset can be considered as a contribution to the Model View Definition for FM." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Energy management systems in buildings and their district today use automation systems and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for smart energy management, but they fail to achieve the desired results due to the lack of holistic and optimised decision-making. A reason for this is the silo-oriented approach to the decision-making failing to consider cross-domain data. Ontologies, as a new way of processing domain knowledge, have been increasingly applied to different domains using formal and explicit knowledge representation to conduct smart decision-making. In this PhD research, Real-time Multiscale Smart Energy Management and Optimisation (REMO) ontology was developed, as a cross-domain knowledge-base, which consequently can be used to support holistic real-time energy management in districts considering both demand and supply side optimisation. The ontology here, is also presented as the core of a proposed framework which facilitates the running of AI solutions and automation systems, aiming to minimise energy use, emissions, and costs, while maintaining comfort for users. The state of the art AI solutions for prediction and optimisation were concluded through authors involvement in European Union research projects. The AI techniques were independently validated through action research and achieved about 30 - 40 % reduction in energy demand of the buildings, and 36% reduction in carbon emissions through optimisation of the generation mix in the district. \nThe research here also concludes a smart way to capture the generic knowledge behind AI models in ontologies through rule axiom features, which also meant this knowledge can be used to replicate these AI models in future sites. Both semantic and syntactic validation were performed on the ontology before demonstrating how the ontology supports the various use cases of the framework for holistic energy management. Further development of the framework is recommended for the future which is needed for it to facilitate real-time energy management and optimisation in buildings and their district." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Existing BIM technologies do not provide links to product components that are needed to facilitate the participation of manufacturers in the design and building processes. A deeper integration between product component catalogues and BIM is necessary for this purpose. Through the Linked Data approach, information about building products can be obtained from multiple sources and linked to create semantic descriptions of components that can be retrieved from a BIM model via component catalogues. In this article, we present the case of an application of Semantic Web technologies to connect BIM models with a catalogue of structural precast concrete components, carried out within the research project BAUKOM. As a proof of concept we have implemented a service which accesses the information provided by the catalogue to assist the design team in the assembly and dimensioning of structural components during the project phase." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "To achieve energy-efficient design in urban communities, the design phase needs to adopt reliable energy modeling approaches. However, current urban modeling approaches often use abstract and low level information to describe buildings because of the difficulties of collecting and managing building data on the large scale required of such urban communities. This abstraction of building data creates large uncertainties in the modeling and simulation of energy scenarios at the community level. An important part of the solution to this challenge relies on the integration of information systems at the scale of both urban communities and individual buildings, which are based on geographic information system (GIS) and building information modeling (BIM) respectively. Since current technologies do not sufficiently address the interoperability between GIS and BIM, the existing conversion between GIS and BIM does not satisfy the data requirements for community energy design. This paper investigates this challenge and presents an approach that uses semantic web technologies, including web ontology language (OWL) and resource description framework (RDF), to integrate GIS and BIM data. In this approach, we use an extract, transform and load (ETL) tool to convert GIS and BIM data to RDF and conduct queries on the integrated RDF to provide the required information for energy simulation. The approach is tested through a case study of the University of British Columbia campus." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The nation’s massive underground utility infrastructure must comply with a multitude of regulations. The regulatory compliance checking of underground utilities requires an objective and consistent interpretation of the regulations. However, utility regulations contain a variety of domain-specific terms and numerous spatial constraints regarding the location and clearance of underground utilities. It is challenging for the interpreters to understand both the domain and spatial semantics in utility regulations. To address the challenge, this paper adopts an ontology and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automate the interpretation of utility regulations – the extraction of regulatory information and the subsequent transformation into logic clauses. Two new ontologies have been developed. The urban product ontology (UPO) is domain-specific to model domain concepts and capture domain semantics on top of heterogeneous terminologies in utility regulations. The spatial ontology (SO) consists of two layers of semantics – linguistic spatial expressions and formal spatial relations – for better understanding the spatial language in utility regulations. Pattern-matching rules defined on syntactic features (captured using common NLP techniques) and semantic features (captured using ontologies) were encoded for information extraction. The extracted information elements were then mapped to their semantic correspondences via ontologies and finally transformed into deontic logic (DL) clauses to achieve the semantic and logical formalization. The approach was tested on the spatial configuration-related requirements in utility accommodation policies. Results show it achieves a 98.2% precision and a 94.7% recall in information extraction, a 94.4% precision and a 90.1% recall in semantic formalization, and an 83% accuracy in logical formalization." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Accurate and valid data is essential during the development of building projects and throughout the use phase of buildings. This study proposes a framework to help owners and facility managers in: (a) defining the requirements for asset management tasks in a structured way; (b) validating project and asset data against the established requirements; and (c) visualising asset data, stored in different and distributed sources, in an integrated and interactive way to support specific asset/facility management functions (e.g. maintenance tasks). The framework combines the use of Information Delivery Manual (IDM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie), and Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) in the development of Asset Information Models (AIM) to fulfil the owner’s requirements (Asset Information Requirements) throughout the lifecycle of a building. An AIM is a data model that contains all digital data (graphical, non-graphical, and documentary) required to operate an asset or portfolio of assets. Validation methods are identified for each of the AIM data types and a method for their integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual environment.\nThe proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the validation of the various data sources against the client requirements, defined in the Asset Information Requirement (AIR); and (2) the visualisation of asset data required for a maintenance task in an interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the capability of the framework to enable the definition of AIR and the validation of the different AIM’s data deliverables. The visualisation of the AIM data - from different and distributed sources - for a maintenance task was successfully performed in an integrated and interactive game environment. Future work will consider other data sources and will evaluate the proposed framework using real industrial data." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "As an important kind of infrastructure, a tunnel's life is estimated to be 100 years or more. During its service life, an effective maintenance strategy plays an essential role in keeping its availability and safety. Maintenance work involves a set of participants, activities, and resources, and in this case, tunnel‐related data are distributed to heterogeneous information management systems in varying formats, bringing difficulties to implement effective maintenance. This paper proposes an E‐maintenance Framework for Public Infrastructure (EFPI), combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), and Semantic Web technologies to help integrate heterogeneous data and expert knowledge, enable information sharing through the whole life cycle, and support maintenance managers to make effective maintenance decisions. A cost estimation case is provided in this paper to illustrate the implementation mechanism and validate the proposed approach." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provide safer, greener, and more convenient mobility, while reducing the impact on the environment. In recent years, simulation platforms have been employed to study ITS applications, mostly focusing on traffic-related simulations. Despite several research studies on ITS applications and simulation platforms, formal semantic descriptions of intelligent transportation systems have not been addressed yet. In this paper, a semantic model describing intelligent transportation systems for roads is proposed. The semantic model is devised to provide a basis for designing ITS simulation platforms. Building upon the semantic model, an extension to an open building information modeling (BIM) standard, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema, is presented. The IFC schema extension is verified and validated using a BIM-based simulation scenario of ITS for roads. It is shown that the proposed IFC-compliant description of ITS for roads provides a formal basis for generating BIM-based simulations and hence facilitates ITS infrastructure modeling in BIM projects. It is concluded that the present work represents a cornerstone for designing BIM-based ITS simulation platforms. In future endeavors, potential standardization and formalization efforts may be discussed." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Today's construction industry relies heavily on high-performing building information modelling (BIM) systems. By deploying the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a description language, these systems offer building information in a widely interoperable format, so that several applications are able to infer extra information. For a certain functionality, IFC shows limitations however. Existing semantic web technology may be able to overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building design and construction. An implemented test case for acoustic performance checking illustrates the improvements of such an environment compared to traditionally deployed approaches in rule checking." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "In the Building Information Modeling world, compliance checking of IFC models is an immense challenge. Many approaches such as Hard Coded Rule Checking, Query based Rule Checking, Rule Checking Approaches via dedicated rule languages (SWRL, Jess, N3Logic, etc., are being contributed to fulfil these requirements. In this paper, we present our research and development of Semantic BIM Reasoner (SBIM-Reasoner) tool for measuring and ensuring conformance of IFC models. SBIM-Reasoner implements multi-threading approach for embedding semantic querying and rule based approach for developing French building code compliance system. Various pre-processors (IFC2RDF Converter, Geometry Extractor, Rule Evaluator, etc.) run in different execution threads to build the underlying semantic repository providing faster rule checking and information retrieval from the triple store. When it finds non-compliant objects in the IFC model, it presents them to the end-user. With the knowledge graph over triplets, we have the freedom of extending our semantic IFC model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation of newer rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with conditions and constraints over IFC data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the initial data of IFC model, etc. We present encouraging results by various tests which were build using online IFC test models of various sizes and designs to test the performance of SBIM-Reasoner." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Improving the performance of existing buildings has provided a broad market for the green renovation of US building stock currently estimated at 76 billion square feet. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has had a remarkable impact on the building industry by enhancing productivity and document accuracy. The integrative nature of BIM technology renders it an ideal tool for implementing sustainable strategies into the renovation and retrofit of existing structures. The intent of this research is to determine what functions of BIM could be utilized to implement sustainable design principles in new and existing structures in Saudi Arabia by exploring the nature of the relationship between BIM platforms and sustainability. The study sought to establish a framework for sustainability in Saudi Arabia. In recent times, Saudi Arabia’s market gasoline prices have dropped dramatically, necessitating the kingdom to establish its 2030 vision. The 2030 vision aims to make Saudi Arabia an ideal sustainable society by reducing its reliance on petrol, creating more sustainable buildings, and using renewable energy resources. Due to the lack of a national rating system in the kingdom, LEED will be used as a guideline to formulate a unique rating system suitable for Saudi Arabia and supports the kingdom’s 2030 vision. This research aims to provide a BIM framework to achieve the envisioned sustainability goals and implement sustainable design principles in Saudi Arabia. Further, the study aims to develop a new rating system for Saudi Arabia that is fully integrated with BIM platforms." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "A construction project requires collaboration of several organizations such as owner, designer, contractor, and material supplier organizations. These organizations need to exchange information to enhance their teamwork. Understanding the information received from other organizations requires specialized human resources. Construction cost estimating is one of the processes that requires information from several sources including a building information model (BIM) created by designers, estimating assembly and work item information maintained by contractors, and construction material cost data provided by material suppliers. Currently, it is not easy to integrate the information necessary for cost estimating over the Internet. This paper discusses a new approach to construction cost estimating that uses Semantic Web technology. Semantic Web technology provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that enables accessing, combining, and sharing information over the Internet in a machine processable format. The estimating approach presented in this paper relies on BIM, estimating knowledge, and construction material cost data expressed in a web ontology language. The approach presented in this paper makes the various sources of estimating data accessible as Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) endpoints or Semantic Web Services. We present an estimating application that integrates distributed information provided by project designers, contractors, and material suppliers for preparing cost estimates. The purpose of this paper is not to fully automate the estimating process but to streamline it by reducing human involvement in repetitive cost estimating activities." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Actors in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner and Operation (AECOO) industry traditionally exchange building models as files. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology advocates the seamless exchange of all information between related stakeholders using digital technologies. The ultimate evolution of the methodology, BIM Maturity Level 3, envisions interoperable, distributed, web-based, interdisciplinary information exchange among stakeholders across the life-cycle of buildings. The World Wide Web Consortium Linked Building Data Community Group (W3C LBD-CG) hypothesises that the Linked Data models and best practices can be leveraged to achieve this vision in modern web-based applications. In this paper, we introduce the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) as a core vocabulary to this approach. It provides a high-level description of the topology of buildings including storeys and spaces, the building elements they contain, and their web-friendly 3D models. We describe how existing applications produce and consume datasets combining BOT with other ontologies that describe product catalogues, sensor observations, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices effectively implementing BIM Maturity Level 3. We evaluate our approach by exporting and querying three real-life large building models." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The upcoming next generation of the Internet, often referred to as the semantic Web, will bring a lot of new technologies, one of which is the Web ontology language (OWL). One feature of this language is to support interoperability between software applications, including Web services and intelligent agents. Another technology to bring interoperability between software programs is ISO-10303 Standard Exchange of Product data (STEP). The industry foundation classes (IFC) have been developed as a building information model for the building and construction industry using technology from STEP. Converting IFC to OWL can be done on different ways. A unidirectional conversion from an IFC to an OWL has been developed for research purposes. The developed prototype converts not all the IFC data to OWL but supports the search for a more appropriate mapping. As the conversion is not straightforward, reengineering the building model to gain more advantages of functionality offered by OWL has to be investigated." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Building design requires different types of knowledge. However, only structural knowledge is explicitly represented in current Building Information models. Other types of knowledge, such as those related to functional and behavioral aspects of design, remain tacit or described in ad-hoc terms by relying on structural properties as representational surrogates (e.g. geometry). The lack of a formal, model-based representation of functional knowledge limits the scope of semantics required to provide better computational support in performance-based building design. To address this problem, the research proposes the development of a representational framework for the functional and behavioral characterization of building elements based on the Functional Representation (FR) schema, and its formalization under the DOLCE foundation ontology. Part of this formalization has been translated into the Web Ontology Language to explore capabilities of DL reasoners to support inference of functional interdependencies affecting performance. An overview of the main theoretical background adopted is provided. Preliminary results and future lines of research are also presented." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Rule checking is important to assure the integrity, correctness and usability of Building Information Models (BIMs) in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) projects. Semantic web based rule checking of BIM models are widely accepted and studied recent years. This technology has noteworthy advantages on interoperability, extensibility and logical basics. However, there are still some gaps to make it practical. One challenge is the efficiency problem on processing large-scale BIM models. The other is how to effectively input checking rules which can be understood by both human beings and machines. In this paper, we propose a pragmatic method to check real-world scale BIM models. In our framework, BIM models are transformed into a well-defined OWL model. Rules are formalized by a structured natural language (SNL) designed intentionally to describe building regulations. The checking engine is based on SPARQL queries on OWL models. We propose a rule-based model extraction method and optimization strategies on SPARQL statements, which can effectively improve the time efficiency and deal with large-scale applications. A prototype has been implemented and applied to BIM models of a real-world building project. We found out non-trivial problems in a totally automatic way, which helped to improve the quality of BIM models and verified the usability of our method." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Recent advances in Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies have resulted in a rising demand for real applications of this kind of tools, in addition to the usual standard functions. Building design code-checking is a task that has been found to be suitable for automation, allowing for swifter, more rigorous and transparent procedures. This paper presents research conducted at the University of Porto that has resulted in an original method and a software application for the automated code-checking of building water network designs. Although the methods are based on the main Portuguese regulations, they may be adapted to other countries. The paper presents a review of the core principles behind BIM-based automated code-checking, and discusses the role of the IFC model as a viable format for the exchange of data in a code-checking system, as well as current international automated code-checking initiatives. The authors conclude that automated code-checking procedures can be feasibly implemented in the short term in some domains, and that they may provide a significant incentive towards widespread BIM adoption." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract A pronounced gap often exists between expected and actual building performance. The multi-faceted and cross lifecycle causes of this performance gap are found in design assumptions, construction issues and commissioning and operational compromises. Some important factors are firmly rooted in the lack of interoperability around building information. New solutions to the interoperability challenge offer the potential to leverage and reuse available heterogeneous data in a manner that can significantly assist building performance assessment. Linked data provides an open, modular and extensible solution for the challenge. However, in the buildings domain, the integration of rule-based performance metrics and contextual information has yet to be formally established. This paper describes an approach to the provision of in-depth building performance assessment through the integration of OpenMath and linked data. An ontology describing performance metrics in RDF is presented, together with an automated metric evaluation solution using multi-silo queries and computer algebra systems, providing a flexible, automated and extensible mechanism for the assessment of building performance. Building managers and engineers can simultaneously analyse time-series building performance at a range of levels, without burdensome manual intervention such as is the case with traditional solutions. A test implementation on a large university building highlights the potential of this solution." ;

We examine five major industrial efforts in detail, all relying on IFC building models as input. The functional capabilities of a rule checking system are organized into four stages; these functional criteria provide a framework for comparisons of the five systems. The review assesses both the technology and structure of building design rule checking, as an assessment of this new emerging field. The development of rule checking systems for building is very young and only limited user experience is presented. The survey lays out a framework for considering research needed for this area to mature." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract Despite its high potential, the building's sector lags behind in reducing its energy demand. Tremendous savings can be achieved by deploying building management services during operation, however, the manual deployment of these services needs to be undertaken by experts and it is a tedious, time and cost consuming task. It requires detailed expert knowledge to match the diverse requirements of services with the present constellation of envelope, equipment and automation system in a target building. To enable the widespread deployment of these services, this knowledge-intensive task needs to be automated. Knowledge-based methods solve this task, however, their widespread adoption is hampered and solutions proposed in the past do not stick to basic principles of state of the art knowledge engineering methods. To fill this gap we present a novel methodological approach for the design of knowledge-based systems for the automated deployment of building management services. The approach covers the essential steps and best practices: (1) representation of terminological knowledge of a building and its systems based on well-established knowledge engineering methods; (2) representation and capturing of assertional knowledge on a real building portfolio based on open standards; and (3) use of the acquired knowledge for the automated deployment of building management services to increase the energy efficiency of buildings during operation. We validate the methodological approach by deploying it in a real-world large-scale European pilot on a diverse portfolio of buildings and a novel set of building management services. In addition, a novel ontology, which reuses and extends existing ontologies is presented." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Commercial buildings have long since been a primary target for applications from a number of areas: from cyber-physical systems to building energy use to improved human interactions in built environments. While technological advances have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema which would reduce the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different buildings. Recent attempts have sought to address this issue through data standards and metadata schemes, but fail to capture the set of relationships and entities required by real applications. Building upon these works, this paper describes Brick, a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight complex unmodified applications on these buildings." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Automation of the code compliance checking has been explored extensively, particularly in recent years with the emergence of building information modelling (BIM). Still, automated code compliance checking has not yet been fully realized, as there is no standardized method for rule interpretation and building model preparation for code compliance. Manual verification of design code compliance, meanwhile, requires significant effort and time and is error-prone, while uncertainty and inconsistency in assessment lead to delays in the construction process. In this paper, the development of a prototype to automate municipal bylaw and wall framing code compliance checking for residential building is presented. The building rules have been classified into three groups based on the complexity involved in translation into computer-readable format and complexity in retrieving the required information, and they are represented based on building objects, which makes the regulations easier to understand and assists in translating the regulations into a computer-readable format. By creating a model view based on the required element's parameters extracted from a model for checking purposes, the prototype application offers automated code compliance checking functionality to validate designs based on building code requirements and construction engineering specifications. The implementation of the prototype and its benefits compared to manual checking is demonstrated." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Specifications of the exact requirements for BIM-based rules are often much more complex than it appears from their direct language interpretation. It is because the complete rule interpretation involves knowledge from human experts. Therefore, detailed interpretation process of rules for the purpose of automated rule checking implementation must be able to capture such knowledge and it must be retained throughout the implementation process. In order to ensure both completeness and precision, the knowledge capture needs to be formalized. We propose a formalized way to capture these requirements using a knowledge representation approach. Detailed analysis of the structure of the rules points to the conceptual graph (CG) as a suitable method for this purpose due to its expressiveness, which allows unambiguous description of the requirements. Such unambiguous description can be understood by all the participants in the implementation efforts. The conceptual graph is a representation that conforms to the first order logic that makes it suitable for the job. Using the conceptual graph, rules can be broken into their atomic rules and incorporates the unwritten domain checking knowledge that if done right will remove ambiguities that often plague building codes. It also provides a standardized way to capture and document the model data requirements and the high level checking logic as their functional requirements. With this, a layer that often separates the rule experts and the implementers can be eliminated, resulting in clarity and immediate usefulness for the implementation. The validity of this assertion is demonstrated using the comparison to the actual corresponding implementation of the rules." ;

These technologies are also becoming more prevalent in the infrastructure and transportation industries. There are challenges to consider when adopting new software or hardware solutions, in which people can be the biggest hurdle. Business owners must be convinced the ROI is there and users must see that the learning curve is not so disruptive that it impacts the project schedule. There can also be reluctance to embrace technology designed to address a process that has “always been done that way.” Nearly everyone agrees that IT makes sense and it is inevitable in the coming years. The questions that need to be addressed are what to adopt and how to do it remain the primary concerns?

        dcterms:abstract  "Marquette University\n\nA construction project requires collaboration of different organizations such as owner, designer, contractor, and resource suppliers. These organizations need to exchange information to improve their teamwork. Understanding the information created in other organizations requires specialized human resources. Construction cost estimating is one of the processes that requires information collected from several sources including a building information model (BIM) created by designers, estimating assembly and work item information maintained by contractors, and construction resource cost information provided by resource suppliers. Currently, it is not easy for computers to integrate the information for construction cost estimating over the Internet. This study discusses a new approach to construction cost estimating that uses the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web technology provides a data modeling format and the required infrastructure that enables accessing, combining, and sharing information over the Internet in a machine processable format. The estimating approach presented in this study relies on BIM, estimating knowledge, and construction material cost data to be represented in the Semantic Web. The approach presented in this study makes the various sources of cost estimating data accessible as Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) endpoints or semantic web services. This study presents an estimating approach that integrates distributed information provided by project designers, contractors, and material suppliers for preparing cost estimates. The purpose of this study is not to fully automate the estimating process but to streamline it by reducing human involvement in repetitive cost estimating activities." ;

An ontology is generally defined as “a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization”, after Studer et al. [1]. Because not only people, but also technologies rely on these ontologies, it is important that they are well conceived and well developed. In this tutorial session, we will therefore give an overview of the main principles behind ontological engineering. We will hereby rely on the principles that are developed as part of the NeOn methodology for ontology engineering [2]. A schema of this methodology is provided in Figure 1." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The Building Information Modeling (BIM) and its applications enable an automatic building permit process based on 3D building models and their associated information. A crucial part of the building permit process is the interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other countries and their projects have developed a certain type of rule-translation methods, KBimCode, part of the KBim application series, has been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an automatic, BIM-based building permit system on top of the current e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule reviewers. This paper describes a KBimCode visual language that is easy-to-write and intuitive because it uses visual symbols instead of textual coding.HighlightsKBVL is an approach to computer-readable building code in visual form.KBVL supports easy-to-make rules for complicated building design rules.This paper demonstrates KBVL using KBimCode for Korean Building permit requirements." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Each domain industry requires the detailed specifications for sharing and exchanging building information models throughout the design, construction, and operation phases. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) Model View Definitions (MVDs) specify required information for exchanges of building model data among building project experts. The data involves the identification of model semantics shared by two or more applications. However, since no robust standard for defining building semantics and requirements for data exchange has been agreed upon, information embedded in domain-specific MVDs are generated separately and are vague in scope, which results in a lack of consistency. In addition, the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) that includes exchange specifications needed for each exchange process of a product model is manually defined in a paper-based document. Because there is no clear logical link between the units of information in the exchange requirements of an IDM, and those of MVDs, the mapping that translates requirements of an IDM into ones of an MVD is open to various interpretation, without semantic and logical consistency. Such challenges might result in redundant requirements and rules for data exchange that are not supposed to be handled in the process of MVDs. To ameliorate this situation, this research proposes the new approach of formalizing domain knowledge and defining accurate data modules for model views. To achieve this goal, the authors employed ontological principles for generating an IDM for the precast concrete domain and for linking its MVD with formal information models. The formalized structure of domain knowledge is expected to support defining explicit data modules and developing manageable relationships among entities using semantic reasoning so that domain professionals and software vendors can identify the intents of the requirements of mapped MVDs and keep track of mapping problems. Moreover, to integrate IDM and MVD development processes, the ontology-based IDM is parsed and translated from OWL/XML to mvdXML, which automatically generates MVD documentation in the IfcDoc tool." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The tedious process of linking product and process models, particularly at higher levels of detail makes the exploration of multiple construction management strategies prohibitive, especially when looking at the collaboration and social aspects of 4D review meetings (decision making features of support systems, taking into account the behaviour of professionals and the natural user interfaces that should support it). We consider the use of ontologies to be better suited for representing such complex systems, paving the way toward semantic digital twins of the construction site by including concepts beyond traditional 3D model data, such as actors, sensors, management workflows, information over the web, etc. Most importantly, access to web distributed resources can be used for intelligent processing and logic reasoning, bypassing the BIM legacy tools and formats which are becoming more and more limited in an increasingly interconnected world. To address these challenges, we propose a 4D BIM platform architecture that is able to encompass semantic web models representing the building and the construction scheduling information, which are further enriched by the semantics of collaboration planning meeting contexts. The system architecture is comprised of several layers, each of which are presented and discussed." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "This paper aims to present a novel proof-of-concept framework for implementing building information modeling (BIM) Digital Objects (BDO) to automate construction product manufacturers’ processes and augment lean manufacturing.,A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept’s development. From an operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall” research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation.,The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and reduces material wastage.,This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-a-vis theoretical) level. Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Current PLM or BIM based information systems suffer from a lack of checking components for business rules. One reason is the misunderstanding of the role and nature of business rules, and how they should be treated in a product-centric information system. This paper intends to provide both a process and a related model to build such a component and enrich future systems. Rules and requirements process management enables the unambiguous formalization of implicit knowledge contained in business rules, generally expressed in easily understandable language, and leads to the formal expression of requirements. In this paper, the requirements are considered a consequence of the application of a business rule. A conceptual model is then introduced, called DALTON (DAta Linked Through Occurrences Network), which supports this process. In this ontology, concepts and product data, coming for instance from an existing product database, are represented using instances and occurrences, connected together with triples built from business rules and requirements according to previous management processes. An experiment involving a set of SWRL rules is conducted in the Protégé environment that validates the model and the process." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "We report on a project to develop round-trip interoperability between the grid utility and building management systems (BMS), and between buildings running heterogeneous management systems, which have traditionally been information silos. The approach is based on the semantic integration of energy and building information models with a common, or system-agnostic, semantic layer. Standards tend to have a very narrow focus of applicability, so growing a system-agnostic domain model involves the integration of several standards (in this case FSGIM, OpenADR, IFC, SAREF, QUDT, SOSA, NIST Tariff, and BRICK) into a cohesive model. The resulting information layer provides a foundation for round-trip translation, validation, logic, and reasoning, and is part of a cloud-based platform that provides a messaging hub. The approach is currently being tested in a pilot study with 23 buildings in the two primary California power utilities, PG&E and Southern California Edison." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Cost estimating is a vital activity for contractors. Cost estimates require cost information collected from several sources. These sources include material and equipment suppliers. Current estimating software programs maintain a large database of resource cost data which must be updated before starting new estimates. The process of updating such databases is both time consuming and error prone. This paper discusses the architecture of a new approach to construction cost estimating using the semantic web technology. The semantic web technology structures data according to formal ontologies intended to promote machine understanding. Semantic web services provide interfaces for publishing information. The proposed estimating approach requires that suppliers encapsulate their product information within appropriate interfaces and make this information available to contractors through web services. Estimating software applications can retrieve the latest cost data from suppliers’ web services. The paper discusses how ontologies can be used to publish product information and develop ontology-based estimating applications. INTRODUCTION A building construction project is a collection of work items that produce building elements. To estimate the cost of a work item in a project, one needs to know the item quantity and the unit costs of the necessary resources. Current estimating applications keep a built-in database of resource (material, equipment, and labor) costs as shown in Figure 1. Item quantities are digitally extracted from a building model. Resource costs continuously change; however, current estimating applications do not have the built-in capability to update their cost databases. Therefore, estimators must obtain the latest resource costs from suppliers and manually update estimating application databases, which is a time consuming process." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real building data stored in an industry specific format (the IFCs). The adoption of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of the regulation scheme within 18months. We believe that these positive results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible benefits." ;

BIM-AM data integration has come with issues related to establishing an effective process to extract, store, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Several information exchange specifications such as COBie and SPARKie have been developed to enable effective interoperability for better building assets operation and maintenance. Due to asset heterogeneity, the exchange models cannot be generalised and applied to all assets systems. Exchange models need to be developed for particular asset systems based on their functionality and building type. In order to contribute to overcoming the BIM-AM interoperability challenge, this study aims to provide the required semantic and syntactic interoperability aspects for the data exchange of assets that consume energy from the BIM systems to the AM systems during the handover stage." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Digital planning methods are changing the needs of construction stakeholders. It should be as easy as possible to compare product data from different manufacturers and integrate them into the planning model without detours. Web technologies not only offer great potential to enhance existing ways of working, but also open up new business models for product manufacturers in the service and IOT domains. However, manufacturers have a legitimate interest to retain control over the disclosure of their product data. Therefore, it is often only available offline and on demand. Of technical interest are therefore solutions, in which a large part of the data autonomy and access control remains on the side of the manufacturer, but the project planner is allowed to search the product data of all manufacturers like an interconnected system. Frequently, such a searchability is ensured by a uniform data schema and storage of the data in a central storage location, a so-called data warehouse. Nonetheless, this stands in contrast to the natural interest of the manufacturer for data sovereignty. This paper focuses on systems that can replace centralized data storage with distributed data management on manufacturer-owned servers, without losing accessibility for planners. Manufacturers should have as much freedom of implementation as possible when establishing the security concept, modeling their data and integrating the proposed approach into their operating procedure." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "As building information modeling (BIM) is expanding its influence in various fields of architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC-FM) industry, BIM-based automated code compliance checking has become possible prospects. For the automated code compliance checking, requirements in building code need to be processed into explicit representation that enables automated reasoning. This paper aims to develop high-level methods that translate verb phrases into explicit representation. The high-level methods represent conditions, properties, and related actions of the building objects and clarify the core content of the constraints. The authors analyze building permit requirements in Korea Building Code and establish a standardized process of deriving the high-level methods. As a result, 60 kinds of the high-level methods were derived. In addition, method classification, analysis, and application are introduced.

        dcterms:abstract  "This paper aims to describe the definition of KBimCode Language and to demonstrate its actual use case. KBimCode is a domain-specific computer language to represent the regulatory sentences in the Korea Building Act as explicit computable rules currently focusing on the building permit-related requirements. As other domain-specific languages are usually in pursuit of both ease-of-use and adequate fidelity to deal with complex domain-specific issues, KBimCode also aims to accomplish a neutral and standardized way of rule-making in an easy-to-use syntax. To address how KBimCode has achieved such objectives, the following main topics are covered in this paper: 1) Language design: features of the Korea Building Act are reflected in a strategy for lexical and syntactic design of KBimcode Language; 2) Language definition: based on the context-free EBNF notation, specifications of KBimCode Language are described; 3) Demonstration: KBimCode can be applied to a BIM assessment tool and executed for rule checking. The examples presented in this paper describe the series of the process. KBimCode is one of the outcomes of an ongoing research project to develop automated design review systems for building permits in Korea." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract In the existing building facilities context, the BIM substantial intervention concerning semantics and as-is information based portrayal for maintenance requirements is very confined. This confinement stresses the challenges associated with the lack and absence of reusing existing building facilities, as is domain knowledge. Within this scope, this paper proposes a novel approach for existing building facilities semantic-enrichment from indoor digital scanning portrayal phase to semantics depiction and management phase for renovation, rehabilitation, or restoration functions. In this paper, we present an ontological system, which relies on integrating the as-is information BIM and semantic web technology. The developed approach improves existing building facilities, as-is information formalization, and management for maintenance purposes. The paper outcome is a semantically integrated knowledge-based framework that can potentially: 1) constitute a semantic database for building facilities components as-is information using BIM; 2) overcome the lack and absence of retrieving and reusing building facilities as-is domain information; and (3) formalize the building facilities as-is knowledge in a computable way." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The Building Information Model (BIM) has become a key tool to achieve communication during the whole building life-cycle. Open standards, such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), have contributed to expand its adoption, but they have limited capabilities for cross-domain information integration and query. To address these challenges, the Linked Building Data initiative promotes the use of ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in order to create more formal and interoperable BIMs. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based extension of such semantic BIMs that provides support for imprecise knowledge representation and retrieval. We propose an expressive fuzzy ontology language, and describe how to use a fuzzy reasoning engine in a BIM context with selected examples. The resulting fuzzy semantic BIM enables new functionalities in the project design and analysis stages—namely, soft integration of cross-domain knowledge, flexible BIM query, and imprecise parametric modeling." ;

Furthermore, the design of healthcare facilities is highly constrained by regulations containing a wide range of requirements. Using BIM for automated rule checking has been pointed out as an opportunity to improve requirements management in these projects. However, most existing research is focused on hard-coded approaches or on limited sets of requirements. The aim of this investigation is to propose a semantic-based framework for automated rule checking in the context of healthcare design. An empirical study was conducted in the redevelopment of a university hospital, using Design Science Research as a methodological approach. Results indicate that the nature of regulations and the subjectivity of requirements have a major impact on the possibility of their translation into logical rules, which is needed to enable automated checking. The main theoretical contribution is a taxonomy for automated rule checking and information transformation." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Easy and solid information exchange constitutes an important part in BIM-based projects. To conduct reliable simulations and optimizations, information about products, such as luminaries, windows, doors, etc., need to be provided by the manufacturing industries to the building designers at the early design stage. Several studies and ongoing researches presented the Semantic Web (SW) and Linked Data (LD) technologies as an interoperable and flexible approach for providing product information from the manufacturers during the design and construction stage as well as gathering consumers data to the manufacturers during the operation stage. A systematic literature review has been conducted to investigate benefits and limitations of using the SW and LD technologies for developing product data templates for information exchanges between the building and product manufacturing industries in comparison with the conventional approach of information ex-changes using the openBIM standards. Results show that SW and LD could apport considerable benefits to the information exchange in the building sector. Moreover, SW and LD technologies enable the sharing of products’ information from manufacturers to designers who can search product information, compare different products and take informed design decisions during the very beginning of the design process." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "With the rapidly growing number of online product models in construction industry, there is an urgent need for developing effective domain-specific information retrieval methods. Explicit semantic analysis (ESA) is a method that automatically extracts concept-based features from human knowledge repositories for semantic retrieval. This avoids the requirement of constructing and maintaining an explicitly formalized ontology. However, since domain-specific knowledge repositories are relatively small, the available terminologies are insufficient and concepts have coarse granularity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ESA method for product model retrieval in construction industry. The major enhancements for the original ESA method consist of two parts. First, a novel concept expansion algorithm is proposed to solve the problem caused by insufficient terminologies. Second, a reranking algorithm is developed to solve the problem caused by coarse granularity of concepts. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of product model retrieval and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also applicable to product retrieval in other engineering domain if a specific knowledge repository is provided in that domain." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract Defect data contains knowledge about specific work conditions. In order to prevent reoccurrence of defects, a data feedback mechanism is required. However, most defect data are stored in unstructured ways, resulting in the fundamental problem of data utilization. This paper proposes a novel framework by using BIM and linked data technologies for sharing defect data between heterogeneous data sources in a new way. To demonstrate, a defect ontology is developed, work context information is extracted from BIM models, extracted BIM data is converted to RDF format, and SPARQL queries are implemented. The proposed approach could help BIM software applications to take into account information stemming from the defect management domain. Also, it can reduce data search time and improve the accuracy of search results as well. Therefore, this framework may enable reductions of defect occurrence and improvements in current defect management practices." ;

Not until recently have the importance of structural engineering and its contribution to sustainable building design been full recognised. However, due to the highly fragmented and diversity of knowledge across building and infrastructure domains, there is a lack of approach that can address all the sustainable issues within the structural design. +is paper reviews the sustainable design from the perspective of structural engineering: (1) reviewing the current situation; (2) identifying the gaps and difficulties; and (3) making recommendations for future improvements. +e strategies and indicators, as well as BIM-enabled methodology, for sustainable structural design (SSD) are also discussed in a holistic way. +e results of this investigation show that most of the methods are not doing well in terms of delivering a successful sustainable structural design. It is expected that the future BIM could probably provide such a platform to address these issues." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract An increasing number of information management and information exchange applications in construction industry is relying on semantic web technologies or tools from the Linked Open Data (LOD) domain to support data interoperability, flexible data exchange, distributed data management and the development of reusable tools. These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Building construction industry has significant impact on sustainability. The construction, operation and maintenance of buildings account for approximately 50% of global energy usage and anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In recent years, the embodied energy and carbon are identified increasingly important in terms of sustainability throughout building life cycle. Incorporation of sustainable development in building structural design becomes undoubtedly crucial. The effective building design requires smart and holistic tools that can process multi-objective and inter-connected domain knowledge to provide genuine sustainable buildings. \nWith the advancement of information and communication technologies, various methods and techniques have been applied to accomplish the multiple objectives of sustainable development in building design. One of the most successful approaches is building information modelling (BIM), which requires further enhancement of interoperability. The emergence of Semantic Web technology provides more opportunity to improve the information modelling, knowledge management and system integration. \nThe research presented in this thesis investigates how ontology and Semantic Web rules can be used in a knowledge-based holistic system, in order to integrate information about structural design and sustainability, and facilitate decision-making in design process by recommending appropriate solutions for different use cases. A research prototype namely OntoSCS incorporating OWL ontology and SWRL rules has been developed and tested in typical structural design cases. The holistic approach considers five inter-connected dimensions of sustainability, including structural feasibility, embodied energy and carbon, cost, durability and safety. In addition, the selection of structural material supplier and criteria in sustainability assessment are taken into account as well. This research concludes that the Semantic Web technology can be applied to structural design at early stage to provide multi-criteria optimised solution. The methodology and framework employed in this study can be further adapted as a generic multi-criteria and holistic decision support system for other domains in construction sector." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Blockchain is a technology concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications beyond serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized and an immutable ledger that records every transaction made in the network. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would result in augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command by encouraging trust and collaboration. This paper present examines the potential integration with the BIM process in advancing the automation of the design review process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the automating the design review process by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The paper evaluates the potential application of blockchain technologies such as Smart Contracts in cybersecurity, data ownership and other aspects, as well as enhancing the framework for automating the design review process with a demonstration using Hyperledger Fabric." ;

Road intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have been studied in recent decades through simulation platforms that integrate computational models for various use cases, such as traffic lights control and management. However, semantic descriptions, illustrating road ITS as a whole and creating a basis for designing simulation platforms, have not been addressed. In this paper, a semantic model of road intelligent transportation systems is proposed, which describes road ITS components and architecture, serving as a formal basis for road ITS simulation platforms. Building upon the semantic model, an extension of the Industry Foundation Classes schema, facilitating ITS simulation platforms based on building information modeling, is discussed. The paper concludes with a summary, a discussion, and an outlook on potential formalization efforts." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "As an important kind of infrastructure, a tunnel’s life is estimated to be 100 years or more. During its service life, effective maintenance strategy plays an essential role to keep its availability and safety. Maintenance work involves a set of participants, activities and resources, bringing difficulties to implement effective maintenance. This paper proposes an e-maintenance framework combining BIM, IFC and semantic web technologies to help maintenance managers and maintenance personnel to get information they need timely and accurately, making effective maintenance decisions. A cost analysis case is provided in this paper to illustrate the implementation mechanism and the validation of this method." ;

The main features of the platform are an ontology (to encapsulate human knowledge) and a set of web services to support the management of ontology (creation, updates), user management (profiling) and handling knowledge management requirements (indexing, documentation, retrieval and dissemination). Implementation of e-COGNOS platform (at leading European construction organizations) has proven the benefit of semantic systems as they provided adequate search and indexing capabilities, allowed for a systematic procedure for formally documenting and updating organizational knowledge (through the ontology) and enhanced the customization functions in a knowledge management systems (through user profiling). The development and implementation of the e-COGNOS platform has also shown that the managerial aspect of knowledge management (in terms of integrating knowledge in daily processes and the link between knowledge and organizational structure) is harder to attain." ;

This paper presents a unified framework for the automatic extraction and integration of building energy consumption data from heterogeneous building management systems, along with building static data from building information models to serve analysis applications. This paper also proposes a diagnosis framework based on density-based clustering and artificial neural network regression using the integrated data to identify anomalous energy usages. The framework and the methods have been implemented and validated from data collected from a multitude of large-scale public buildings across China." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become popular in the architectural, engineering, construction and Operations (AECO) industry, and BIM has been used in the lifecycle of projects. As more data is added to a BIM model, the complexity and data volume of the model increases. Further, many design changes are made to a building information model during design and construction phases, and it is difficult to extract and visualize the changed objects. Research on the use of ontology in BIM is also limited. The purpose of this study therefore is to use an ontology to visualize revised objects in BIM models. This research uses the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, a widely-supported open standard for building information models. The changed objects in the BIM model are extracted by comparing the revised model to the original model, and a model report of the design change is provided. A prototype program using a sample IFC model is developed to validate the system. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is valid for the extraction and visualization of design changes in BIM models." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Both planning and design phase of large infrastructural project require analysis, modelling, visualization, and numerical analysis. To perform these tasks, different tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and numerical analysis software are commonly employed. However, in current engineering practice, there are no systematic solutions for the exchange between design and analysis models, and these tasks usually involve manual and error-prone model generation, setup and update. In this paper, focussing on tunnelling engineering, we demonstrate a systematic and versatile approach to efficiently generate a tunnel design and analyse the lining in different practical scenarios. To this end, a BIM-based approach is developed, which connects a user-friendly industry-standard BIM software with effective simulation tools for high-performance computing. A fully automatized design-through-analysis workflow solution for segmented tunnel lining is developed based on a fully parametric design model and an isogeometric analysis software, connected through an interface implemented with a Revit plugin." ;

Go-ing beyond the geometric representation of a building, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an approach that aims at integrating into one single system heterogeneous data and processes from different actors. Such integration is a complex and fastidious task. The implementation of the related processes for data querying, retrieval or modification is not less difficult. To tackle this prob-lem, we have developed a novel approach based on Semantic Web technolo-gies. In doing so, we have defined an ontology inspired on IFC standard for rep-resenting building information. On top of this ontology, we have defined and implemented a set of SWRL rules. The paper at hand describes these rules and their application in the context of building information handling (notably by means of IFC files)" ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract The management of information throughout a building's lifecycle is becoming increasingly important, and building information modeling (BIM) is often used to ensure the interoperability of data. However, BIM-based facility information from the construction phase is difficult to access and use during the operation and maintenance phase. This occurs because the BIM information is not utilized well in facility management (FM). In this research, we propose an approach to effectively manage BIM-based FM information by linking the BIM-based building elements and FM work information in an FM system database. We present a Semantic Web-based FM information system that semantically links BIM data to relevant historical work records. The proposed ontology was evaluated using a sample dataset of the architectural maintenance work records of an office building. Using the proposed approach, facility managers will be able to increase their efficiency in searching related work records that consider shared BIM objects by enhancing the interoperability and accessibility of FM data via the Semantic Web." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Regulations play an important role in assuring the construction quality. However, due to the large amount of regulation needs considered, the construction quality compliance checking against regulations can be cumbersome/time-consuming and error prone. In order to give more computerized support to the construction quality compliance checking against regulations, an ontology-based semantic modeling approach of regulation constraints is explored. A meta model for construction quality inspection and evaluation i.e. CQIEOntology is proposed in this paper. Based on CQIEontology, the regulation constraints are modeled into OWL axioms and SWRL rules. By these OWL axioms and SWRL rules, the regulation provisions imposed on construction quality inspection can be translated into a set of inspection tasks, and get associated with the specific construction tasks. Once the construction starts, the applicable inspection tasks, including a series of quality checking and evaluation, will be reminded and recommended. Obviously, the proposed approach facilitates taking the construction quality compliance checking as a paralleling activity to the construction rather than an afterthought, and helps the inspectors in quality inspection. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in Protégé 3.4.6 through case studies based on regulation examples taken from “Code for Acceptance of Construction Quality of Building Foundation (GB50202-2002) and the validation and discussion are given for it.”" ;

KBimCode is a standardized script language. It is developed to represent the Korean Building Act as explicit computable rules. The application of KBimCode can be summarized as: 1) Preparation of natural language rule, 2) representation of rule, 3) definition of rule, 4) execution of rule, and 5) execution result and report. This paper mainly focuses on describing the process and mechanism of each stage of KBimCode application. First, natural language rules are translated into KBimCode through logic rule-based mechanism. KBimCode are generated and managed by logic rule-based system called KBimLogic. Second, we introduce a design strategy and definition of KBimCode syntax. Application of KBimCode database is also handled. Third, execution of KBimCode is demonstrated with BIM assessment software and its result is reported. For the demonstration presented in this paper, Korean Building Act sentences were translated into KBimCode series and evaluated in a BIM assessment tool named KbimAssess-lite. KBimCode is an ongoing project and will contribute to establish automated design quality assessment system for building permit in Korea." ;

Although several data formats have been developed to capture domainspecific data, none of these schemas can be used for holistic communication and cross-domain data exchange. In this paper, we present approaches for mapping existing domain-specific data formats in a more generic schema like the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). This offers the possibility to develop coordination models for seamless data exchange and improved communication between project stakeholders." ;

        dcterms:abstract   "The Special Issue of Automation in Construction is about why and how to use the Web of Data technologies (RDF, OWL) for building information management (BIM). The article by Radulovic and colleagues, Guidelines for Linked Data Generation and Publication: an Example in Building Energy Consumption, focuses on making a set of guidelines available regarding the proper generation and publication of linked data, aiming specifically at the context of energy consumption in buildings. The article by Terkaj and Sojic, Ontology-based Representation of IFC EXPRESS rules: an enhancement of the ifcOWL ontology, gives a detailed indication of how the recent actions towards the development of an OWL version of the IFC schema can be extended to consider IFC EXPRESS rules. Costa and Madrazo combine both types of information in their article, named Connecting building component catalogues with BIM models using semantic technologies: an application case for precast concrete components, aiming to assist the design team in the assembly and dimensioning of structural components during the project phase. The third article included in this Special Issue is presented by Corry and colleagues, entitled, A performance assessment ontology for the environmental and energy management of buildings. In this article, an investigation is made of the ways in which semantic web technologies can be used to combine all sorts of energy-related data in buildings, so that the performance gap between measured and simulated energy performance level of a building can be made to increase." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract Architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC-FM) projects involve a large number of participants that must exchange information and combine their knowledge for successful completion of a project. Currently, most of the AEC-FM domains store their information about a project in text documents or use XML, relational, or object-oriented formats that make information integration difficult. The AEC-FM industry is not taking advantage of the full potential of the Semantic Web for streamlining sharing, connecting, and combining information from different domains. The Semantic Web is designed to solve the information integration problem by creating a web of structured and connected data that can be processed by machines. It allows combining information from different sources with different underlying schemas distributed over the Internet. In the Semantic Web, all data instances and data schema are stored in a graph data store, which makes it easy to merge data from different sources. This paper presents a shared ontology approach to semantic representation of building information. The semantic representation of building information facilitates finding and integrating building information distributed in several knowledge bases. A case study demonstrates the development of a semantic based building design knowledge base." ;

Although BIM-based model checking (BMC) and similar terms are widely used, there is a lack of joint understanding of the different types of checking and the use of terms. The study uses an ontological approach to develop a framework with the intention to classify unique concepts of BMC. The following concepts for BMC were identified: A) Compliance checking solutions, separated into: 1) Validation checking and 2) Content checking, and B) Design solution checking, separated into: 3) Smart objects checking and 4) Design option checking. All concepts are presented with principles and examples, and as Linked Data with RDF-graph. The impact of this overview can contribute to improved understanding of BMC, improved understanding and clarification of expectations, and joint terms for common use." ;

A large number of both public and private organizations have published their data following the Linked Data principles, or have done so with data from other organizations. To this extent, since the generation and publication of Linked Data are intensive engineering processes that require high attention in order to achieve high quality, and since experience has shown that existing general guidelines are not always sufficient to be applied to every domain, this paper presents a set of guidelines for generating and publishing Linked Data in the context of energy consumption in buildings (one aspect of Building Information Models). These guidelines offer a comprehensive description of the tasks to perform, including a list of steps, tools that help in achieving the task, various alternatives for performing the task, and best practices and recommendations. Furthermore, this paper presents a complete example on the generation and publication of Linked Data about energy consumption in buildings, following the presented guidelines, in which the energy consumption data of council sites (e.g., buildings and lights) belonging to the Leeds City Council jurisdiction have been generated and published as Linked Data." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The Bridge collapse in Genoa let us take a closer look at the health state of bridges. Inspection and maintenance is essential to ensure the serviceability and safety of bridges. Current inspection on site is often done manually on paper, and paper is the medium to exchange condition information between involved stakeholders. After damage registration or information exchange, the data is processed digitally. The repeated digitalization is an error prone process and leads to redundant work. A dedicated information model, called damage information model, could provide a solution to improve the information exchange. This present paper investigates the state of practice and research in damage information modeling for bridges. After analyzing bridge damage data, it reviews different norms, guidelines, and existing research papers. Analyzing different national practices and synthesizing available research results form the basis for the presented achievements and challenges in the field of damage information modelling." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract Since the early 2000s, building information modeling (BIM) has been used through the entire project life cycle to facilitate effective project collaboration and integration of data to support project activities. Despite the successful applications of BIM in the design and construction stages, the use of BIM for preconstruction planning has not gained wide acceptance as in other project phases. The integration of BIM and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the planning process during the design and preconstruction stages. However, this integration suffers from a lack of interoperability across the geospatial and BIM domains. Semantic web technology is used in this study to convey meaning, which is interpretable by both construction project participants as well as BIM and geographic information systems (GIS) applications processing the transferred data. To achieve this, we first translate building's elements and GIS data into a semantic web data format. Then we use a set of standardized ontologies for construction operations to integrate and query the heterogeneous spatial and temporal data. Finally, we use a query language to access and acquire the data in semantic web format. Through two scenario examples, the potential usefulness of the proposed methodology is validated." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "Abstract This paper presents an indoor navigation support system based on the Building Information Models (BIM) paradigm. Although BIM is initially defined for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction/Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry, the authors believe that it can provide added value in this context. To this end, the authors will focus on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard for the formal representation of BIM. The approach followed in this paper will be based on the ifcOWL ontology, which translates the IFC schemas into Ontology Web Language (OWL). Several modifications of this ontology have been proposed, consisting of the inclusion of new items, SWRL rules and SQWRL searches. This way of expressing the elements of a building can be used to code information that is very useful for navigation, such as the location of elements related to the actions desired by the user. It is important to note that this design is intended to be used as a complement to other well-known tools and techniques for indoor navigation. The proposed modifications have been successfully tested in a variety of simulated and real scenarios. The main limitation of the proposal is the immense amount of information contained in the ifcOWL ontology, which causes difficulties involving its processing and the time necessary to perform operations on it. Those elements that are considered important have been selected, removing those that seem secondary to navigation. This procedure will result in a significant reduction in the storage and semantic processing of the information. Thus, for a system with 1000 individuals (in the ontological sense), the processing time is about 90 s. The authors regard this time as acceptable, since in most cases the tasks involved can be considered part of the system initialization, meaning they will only be executed once at the beginning of the process." ;

        dcterms:abstract  "The checking process of the building design with building regulations or codes is a time-consuming and error prone process. The automation of code compliance checking process has been explored since 1960s and becoming more vigorous with the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM). A neutral format, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which is developed under BIM platform had led to better collaboration and information exchange throughout BIM software and development of the checking system. Generally, the structure of an automated system consists of rule interpretation stage, building model preparation stage, rule execution stage and rule reporting stage. Rule interpretation stage is the most vital and complex stage. In interpreting the rules, various techniques have been investigated and applied to employ comprehensive and accurate checking process on the building designs which are mainly in IFC format. The most common techniques used are by utilizing existing software such as Solibri Model Checker, establishing a plug-in application, adopting object-based approach, logical approach and ontological approach. This paper provides a highlight and review on previous studies which successfully employed the appropriate techniques in interpreting the rules for checking purposes. This will subsequently assist future research on this area and create more astounding code compliance checking system." ;
