    Construction projects have temporary fragmented supply chains that face many
    challenges, such as lack of trust, inadequate knowledge management, and poor
    communication. These challenges led to poor performance in terms of low
    productivity, high cost, schedule delay, and poor quality. Construction is a
    conservative industry resists changes to its structure and adoption of
    technology and new management principles. The study aims to develop a value
    stream mapping and information management frameworks for construction
    projects. The developed frameworks can support the elimination of wastes and
    facilitate the integration of the construction supply chain, which
    ultimately reduce the project’s cost and lead time. It can also support the
    current shift towards Industry 4.0, which targets the enabling of
    Construction 4.0. Surveys and interviews are conducted to determine existing
    tools to exchange information, the extent of value stream mapping (VSM)
    adoption, and the key performance indicators in Alberta. The results show
    Alberta’s industry mainly depends on face-to-face discussions, phones, and
    emails to exchange information. The knowledge most likely stays at the
    individual levels and neither shared nor stored and poorly managed. This
    hinders knowledge capitalization, as well as the integration of the value
    chain network. Alberta’s construction industry hasn’t adopted lean
    management tools yet, and no common key performance indicators (KPIs) are
    established. Case studies are completed to implement VSM in procurement case
    studies. The results show traditional VSM can efficiently identify wastes in
    the current state of repetitive construction processes and eliminate them in
    future ones. The study proposed a new VSM framework for non-repetitive
    processes, which is more suitable for onsite construction activities. The
    framework is implemented in case studies. The results show significant
    improvements in terms of reducing wastes and the project’s lead time. The
    construction industry lacks standard methodology for ontology development.
    The ontologies that have been developed in construction have a deficiency in
    a philosophical basis and built for a specific use, and for certain project
    types and phases. To support knowledge management, which can facilitate
    information flow in the construction supply chain, an ontology for
    construction knowledge is developed using the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
    structure, ISO 12006-2 recommendations, and input from industry experts. BFO
    is a mature upper ontology. It provides a framework to build a complete
    ontology based on philosophical basis. An ontology for the VSM framework is
    also developed using the BFO structure, so it can be integrated with the
    construction knowledge ontology. The developed frameworks can also support
    the industry’s current efforts to promote more collaborative project
    delivery approaches

    This paper aims to present a novel proof-of-concept framework for
    implementing building information modeling (BIM) Digital Objects (BDO) to
    automate construction product manufacturers’ processes and augment lean
    manufacturing.,A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological
    lens is adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept’s development. From an
    operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism
    provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a
    case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research
    (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall”
    research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO
    development and validation and evaluation.,The findings illustrate that a
    BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can
    augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction
    product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed
    framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of
    manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model,
    generates financial savings and reduces material wastage.,This research
    provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction
    product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at
    an operational (vis-a-vis theoretical) level. Future research is proposed to
    implement a longitudinal approach to measure and report upon the success (or
    otherwise) of the proof of concept when implemented on fabrications and shop
    floor procedures.

    3D Visualization provides a mean for communicating different construction
    activities to diverse audiences. The scope, level of detail, and time
    resolution of the 3D visualization process are determined based on the
    targeted audiences. Developing the 3D visualization requires obtaining and
    merging heterogeneous data from different sources (such as BIM model and CPM
    schedule). The data merging process is usually carried out on ad hoc basis
    for a specific visualization case which limits the reusability of the
    process. This paper discusses a framework for automatic merging of
    heterogeneous data to create a visualization. The paper describes developing
    an ontology which captures concepts related to the visualization process.
    Then, heterogeneous data sources that are commonly used in construction are
    fed into the ontology which can be queried to produce different
    visualization scenarios. The potential of this approach has been
    demonstrated by providing multiple visualization scenarios that cover
    different audiences, levels of detail, and time resolutions.

    Buildings play an important role in implementing energy efficiency at the
    urban level.

    Since new buildings account just for 1% of the stock, the largest
    opportunity comes from the

    renovation of existing buildings. While installation and commissioning
    procedures for energy

    efficiency elements in new buildings may be well established, renovation
    projects address specific

    challenges. Main particularities are related to unknowns in pre-existing
    conditions, presence of

    occupants, and space/time limitations. This paper presents an ontology
    mapping the knowledge

    regarding the installation procedures of renovation elements and their
    constraints. The Reno-Inst

    ontology may contribute to developing a shared understanding of this domain
    and enable easier

    information processing, reuse and retrieval in renovation projects. The
    ontology development relies

    on literature review, catalogues, guidelines, and input from experts,
    focusing on windows, thermal

    insulation panels, and heat radiators, three common elements of renovation
    projects.

    The quest to automate compliance checking processes needed for planning,
    design, construction and operations has been an active research topic for
    half a century. Literature has provided evidence of extensive research
    effort, with varying degrees of success, alongside the evolution of
    computing and supporting technologies. New innovations in theoretical and
    applied computing, coupled with a strong industry demand, has opened up
    opportunities that promise to bring this quest closer to reality. This paper
    reviews evolving approaches for automated compliance checking, addressing
    challenges in sharing digital architectural and engineering design
    information, formalising normative provisions as computable rules, and
    methods of processing them for compliance. The paper identifies current
    state-of-the-art implementations, discusses challenges faced in national
    efforts, and highlights future pathways.

    What we're looking for in this proposal is a way to simplify the delivery of
    ICDD containers, following the ISO-21597. Considering the great value of
    delivering AECO projects based on open standards in a future-proof way, ICDD
    containers prove to be an important tool towards this direction. However, to
    raise the level of adoption of such initiatives, there is a lot of space for
    making the process more accessible to a wider range of users. Our
    contribution is targeting the end-to-end procedure of producing the ICDD
    container in a painless way for non-experts through a simple web-based
    interface, together with an API for developers. More specifically our
    approach is split into three main steps: 1) After the user specifies the
    directory with all the (local) project files, a Python script produces the
    ISO-defined file structure, while parsing all the available metadata from
    the files. 2) Then, the user adjusts the parsed information and fills up the
    rest, while defining links between the files. 3) The information, which is
    initially registered as an associative array, is processed and transformed
    into an RDF graph. The interface is designed in a way that guarantees the
    appropriate usage of the ontology’s entities and relations, as well as the
    proper literal data types without the explicit definition by the user.
    Additionally, SHACL will be used in the final processing step to verify the
    compliance to the ISO ontology. The whole directory, having been suitably
    configured, is zipped into the ICDD format. Furthermore, the backend code
    can be exposed through a standalone API, which accepts a properly formatted
    JSON file and produces the “index” and “linkset” RDF files. The API is
    considered especially useful for projects involving a big amount of files
    with repetitive link patterns, where batch data processing is more feasible
    than manual configuration. This option can also be considered as additional
    to step “2”, through the injection of the extracted link information to the
    interface. Finally, we are looking closely at approaches that aim to combine
    the ISO-21597 with broader data linking projects like openCDE etc. We would
    also like to open the discussion on how additional synergies with more
    low-level ontologies like BOT or BRICK can be achieved.

    It is widely acknowledged that the integration of BIM and GIS data is a
    crucial step forward for future 3D city modelling, but most of the research
    conducted so far has covered only the high-level and semantic aspects of
    GIS-BIM integration. This paper presents the results of the GeoBIM project,
    which tackled three integration problems focussing instead on aspects
    involving geometry processing: (i) the automated processing of complex
    architectural IFC models; (ii) the integration of existing GIS subsoil data
    in BIM; and (iii) the georeferencing of BIM models for their use in GIS
    software. All the problems have been studied using real world models and
    existing datasets made and used by practitioners in The Netherlands. For
    each problem, this paper exposes in detail the issues faced, proposed
    solutions, and recommendations for a more successful integration.

    Germany invests more than 12 billion Euros in the rail infrastructure in
    2020. Beside

    others, bridges and stations have to be rehabilitated. Several inspections
    and maintenance actions

    take place within these processes during which different actors collect,
    digitize and exchange bridge

    and damage information. Currently, inspection and maintenance practice
    relies on paper based data

    collection and exchange, which is time consuming and error prone. A way of
    storing and exchanging

    damage data in a digital format would lower the costs as well as support
    future needs, e.g. automated

    maintenance planning, structural integrity analysis and mixed reality
    inspections. A majority of

    damages are physical damages, like cracks and spalling. This paper presents
    two different

    approaches to model physical damages using the Industry Foundation Classes
    (IFC). Finally, the

    modelling concepts are tested with multiple BIM applications. Although the
    tests show that IFC is

    capable of modeling physical damages, current software tools do not support
    IFC up to its full

    potential.

    The Bridge collapse in Genoa let us take a closer look at the health state
    of bridges. Inspection and maintenance is essential to ensure the
    serviceability and safety of bridges. Current inspection on site is often
    done manually on paper, and paper is the medium to exchange condition
    information between involved stakeholders. After damage registration or
    information exchange, the data is processed digitally. The repeated
    digitalization is an error prone process and leads to redundant work. A
    dedicated information model, called damage information model, could provide
    a solution to improve the information exchange. This present paper
    investigates the state of practice and research in damage information
    modeling for bridges. After analyzing bridge damage data, it reviews
    different norms, guidelines, and existing research papers. Analyzing
    different national practices and synthesizing available research results
    form the basis for the presented achievements and challenges in the field of
    damage information modelling.

    To achieve energy-efficient design in urban communities, the design phase
    needs to adopt reliable energy modeling approaches. However, current urban
    modeling approaches often use abstract and low level information to describe
    buildings because of the difficulties of collecting and managing building
    data on the large scale required of such urban communities. This abstraction
    of building data creates large uncertainties in the modeling and simulation
    of energy scenarios at the community level. An important part of the
    solution to this challenge relies on the integration of information systems
    at the scale of both urban communities and individual buildings, which are
    based on geographic information system (GIS) and building information
    modeling (BIM) respectively. Since current technologies do not sufficiently
    address the interoperability between GIS and BIM, the existing conversion
    between GIS and BIM does not satisfy the data requirements for community
    energy design. This paper investigates this challenge and presents an
    approach that uses semantic web technologies, including web ontology
    language (OWL) and resource description framework (RDF), to integrate GIS
    and BIM data. In this approach, we use an extract, transform and load (ETL)
    tool to convert GIS and BIM data to RDF and conduct queries on the
    integrated RDF to provide the required information for energy simulation.
    The approach is tested through a case study of the University of British
    Columbia campus.

    Commercial buildings have long since been a primary target for applications
    from a number of areas: from cyber-physical systems to building energy use
    to improved human interactions in built environments. While technological
    advances have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience
    widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema which
    would reduce the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and
    systems to different buildings. Recent attempts have sought to address this
    issue through data standards and metadata schemes, but fail to capture the
    set of relationships and entities required by real applications. Building
    upon these works, this paper describes Brick, a uniform schema for
    representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology
    for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable
    applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by
    using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six
    diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points,
    and running eight complex unmodified applications on these buildings.

    Automated compliance checking brings advantages to the built environment
    but, currently, there has been no meaningful adoption, despite the
    increasing maturity of asset information models. This paper addresses this
    by ascertaining the blockers/obstacles to adoption and develops a road-map
    to overcome them. This work has been conducted in the UK and a road-map has
    been produced to drive forward adoption. More specifically this paper has;
    assessed the current state of the art in the field and engaged with industry
    to examine the attitudes to the digitisation of regulatory compliance
    processes. The results showed that industry believes that adoption of
    automation was both feasible and desirable, with the caveat that human
    oversight be maintained. Our road-map's methodical list of steps was judged
    to have the potential to bring the construction industry to the verge of
    mass industrialisation of automated compliance checking by 2025.

  abstract: >-
    The concept of automated checking can bring tangible advantages including
    increased efficiency and

    a reduction in the costs of compliance checking. The D-COM Research Network
    was formed to meet

    the clear need for research and leadership in this area.

    Through this initial research, DCOM has shown that the concerns raised in
    the Hackitt review of

    responsibility and departures from regulations is a systemic problem. There
    has been a significant rise

    in the formation of government expert groups to address some of these
    failings. DCOM is proposing

    not simply “plugging the leaks”, but a transformation of the regulatory
    compliance system. Digitising

    and automating this system will instil transparency and inherently build in
    the “Golden Thread”.

    The entire lifecycle of the built environment is governed by a variety of
    regulations, requirements and

    standards. The checking of compliance against these is a complex task, which
    is currently performed

    manually, thus becoming highly resource intensive. Recently, the increased
    maturity of information

    models and data and with the adoption of Building Information Modelling
    (BIM) processes, means

    automation of compliance checking is becoming feasible.

    Our vision follows two pathways, the first, where we determined the State of
    the Nation and its views

    of automated compliance checking. Secondly, to engage with key stakeholders
    who inform and drive

    regulatory policy. In following these pathways, we have started to build

    • growing a community

    • defining the capabilities required to deliver automated compliance
    checking

    • developing a roadmap to deliver a working and operating model

    Our work focused around three key themes. These themes were Technology,
    Commercial and

    Political impacts on the reception of digitisation and automation of
    compliance checking.

    This report describes the outcomes from of this work. The key output of the
    work is the D-COM 2025

    roadmap. Our roadmap offers a comprehensive and methodical list of next
    steps. This is a plan for

    the next 6 years that brings the UK to the verge of mass industrialisation
    of automated compliance

    checking by 2025. Our roadmap is organised into four phases. These include a
    phase of research, a

    pilot or proof of concept, a phase of industrialisation, where technologies
    developed for the pilot are

    matured and designed for scalability, and finally, commercial adoption.

  abstract: >-
    A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory
    compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical
    knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail
    and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to
    extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this
    paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology
    to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own
    regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software
    development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic
    contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the
    semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being
    considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for
    compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their
    own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar
    to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature
    of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics
    of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper
    demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of
    regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The
    regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real
    building data stored in an industry specific format (the IFCs). The adoption
    of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these
    complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of
    the regulation scheme within 18months. We believe that these positive
    results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building
    of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of
    three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible
    benefits.

    Linking heterogeneous information models from the domains Building
    In-formation Modelling (BIM) and Geospatial Information Systems (GIS)
    enables syner-getic effects between these domains. A common approach to
    define links between cor-responding objects are identity relation like
    owl:sameAs from the Web Ontology Lan-guage (OWL). Identity relations
    suggests that everything stated about one entity hold for the corresponding
    entity (i.e., they share all of their properties). However, this kind of
    semantics is too strict for linking objects from heterogeneous information
    models. This paper shows the issue of the strict semantics of identity
    relations for linking build-ing elements of heterogeneous information models
    like Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML. In more detail, related
    literature about heterogeneities and links between IFC and CityGML are
    reviewed. Afterwards, the issue caused by the strict semantics of identity
    links for linking IFC and CityGML models is illustrated and al-ternative
    approaches to identity links are discussed. As a result, identity links are
    prone to be misleading for linking building elements represented in Industry
    Foundation Clas-ses (IFC) and CityGML models. However, alternative linking
    approaches have the short coming that they generally rely on the correct
    interpretation of the user.

    AEC/FM industry experiences significant challenges in full adoption of BIM
    despite its obvious benefits. Deficient semantic interoperability between
    BIM applications is one of the factors causing the industry dissatisfaction.
    The IFC schema is the open, international, vendor agnostic standard for data
    exchanges between BIM applications. It is a generic, rich and flexible
    standardized data model. However, the IFC specification lacks formal
    rigidness to unambiguously capture the full semantics needed for seamless
    and reliable information exchanges. A framework for new approach to overcome
    that drawback and improve the overall semantic interoperability is outlined
    in the paper. The novelty of the approach is that it places the onus for
    interpretation of exchanged data on an importing application which is an
    opposite to current practices when an exporting application is responsible
    for a semantic content of IFC exchange file. A pilot technical
    implementation was developed to test the applicability of the approach.

    Significant difficulties remain in exchanging information between building
    information modeling (BIM) tools. The industry foundation classes (IFC)
    exchange schema is too generic to capture the full semantic meaning needed
    for direct use by different construction project stakeholders’ BIM tools.
    Although BIM standards that prescribe model view definitions (MVD) for
    domain-specific exchanges are under development, insufficient semantic
    definition of exchanges prevents achievement of the full potential of BIM
    through seamless interoperability. We propose an innovative approach for
    supplementing an IFC exchange file with semantically useful concepts
    inferred from the explicit and implicit information contained in the
    building model. A prototype software was implemented to test the
    applicability of the approach. It consists of a rule-processing engine and
    allows composition of inference rule-sets that can be tailored for different
    domains. The tests demonstrate semantic enrichment with precast concrete
    building models, adding inferred joint, slab aggregation and connection
    concepts.

    The tedious process of linking product and process models, particularly at
    higher levels of detail makes the exploration of multiple construction
    management strategies prohibitive, especially when looking at the
    collaboration and social aspects of 4D review meetings (decision making
    features of support systems, taking into account the behaviour of
    professionals and the natural user interfaces that should support it). We
    consider the use of ontologies to be better suited for representing such
    complex systems, paving the way toward semantic digital twins of the
    construction site by including concepts beyond traditional 3D model data,
    such as actors, sensors, management workflows, information over the web,
    etc. Most importantly, access to web distributed resources can be used for
    intelligent processing and logic reasoning, bypassing the BIM legacy tools
    and formats which are becoming more and more limited in an increasingly
    interconnected world. To address these challenges, we propose a 4D BIM
    platform architecture that is able to encompass semantic web models
    representing the building and the construction scheduling information, which
    are further enriched by the semantics of collaboration planning meeting
    contexts. The system architecture is comprised of several layers, each of
    which are presented and discussed.

    Abstract As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is
    embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design,
    construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by
    technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor
    networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems
    underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation
    of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value
    chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a
    decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While
    Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data
    schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building
    components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more
    holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the
    complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the
    cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic
    completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks,
    social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus
    requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic
    data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications
    of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements,
    paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition
    of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research
    themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.

    Heterogeneous data, different definitions and incompatible models are a huge
    problem in many domains, with no exception for the field of energy systems
    analysis. Hence, it is hard to re-use results, compare model results or
    couple models at all. Ontologies provide a precisely defined vocabulary to
    build a common and shared conceptualisation of the energy domain. Here, we
    present the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) developed for the domain of energy
    systems analysis. Using the OEO provides several benefits for the community.
    First, it enables consistent annotation of large amounts of data from
    various research projects. One example is the Open Energy Platform (OEP).
    Adding such annotations makes data semantically searchable, exchangeable,
    re-usable and interoperable. Second, computational model coupling becomes
    much easier. The advantages of using an ontology such as the OEO are
    demonstrated with three use cases: data representation, data annotation and
    interface homogenisation. We also describe how the ontology can be used for
    linked open data (LOD).

  abstract: >-
    The paper presents a conceptual study on the application of spatial
    reasoning on building in-

    formation models. In many cases, building regulations and client demands
    imply constraints on the building

    design with inherent spatial semantics. If we are able to represent these
    spatial constraints in a computer-

    interpretable way, the building design can be checked for fulfilling them.
    In this context, spatial reasoning

    technology can be applied in two different ways. First, we can check the
    consistency of the spatial constraints

    in effect, i.e. find out whether there are contradictions between them.
    Second, we can check whether a con-

    crete building design is compliant with these constraints. The paper gives a
    detailed overview on the currently

    available spatial calculi and introduces two possible implementation
    approaches.

    The AEC sector is known to be highly fragmented, different experts requiring
    different information. Current BIM collaborative practices can be described
    as static as they are based on file exchange, mainly using IFC files.
    Instead, in an ideal level 3 BIM platform, different stakeholders could work
    together on a single centralized building model, using different
    domain-specific vocabularies, and updating the model synchronously. We
    propose an approach based on semantic rule reasoning to dynamically convert
    information in different vocabularies. While existing alignments only cover
    class conversions, we develop inference rules that handle conversion of
    relations in a dynamic and transparent way, being executed by a reasoner.
    The approach is implemented and tested on converting models from ifcOWL to
    BIM4Ren, a BOT-based ontology. The scalability of the implementation is
    discussed as well as its limitation.

    Regulations in the Building Industry are becoming increasingly complex and
    involve more than one technical area. They cover products, components and
    project implementations. They also play an important role to ensure the
    quality of a building, and to minimize its environmental impact. Control or
    compliance checking are becoming more complex every day for industrials but
    also for organizations in charge of assessing the conformity of new products
    or processes. This paper will detail the approach taken by the CSTB in order
    to simplify this compliance control task. The approach and the solutions
    proposed are based on semantic web technologies. For this purpose, we first
    elaborate a domain-ontology, which defines the main concepts involved and
    the relationships among them based on OWL. We rely on SBVR and SPARQL to
    reformulate the regulatory requirements written in natural language in a
    controlled and formal language. We structure then our control process based
    on expert practices. Each elementary control step is defined as a SPARQL
    query and assembled into complex control processes " on demand " according
    to the component tested and its semantic definition. Finally, we represent
    in RDF the association between the SBVR rules and SPARQL queries
    representing the same regulatory constraints.

    This open access book describes a BIM-based toolkit that has been developed
    according to the latest research activities on building information
    modelling and semantic interoperability to optimize the building process. It
    highlights the impacts of using such new tools to fast renovation activities
    starting from the decision-making and design stages to the construction site
    management with the possibility to monitor occupants' and owners’ feedback
    during the realization process. In this process, a framework has been
    developed and implemented to allow stakeholders involved in a renovation
    project to efficiently compile, maintain, and add data about (i) building
    elements, (ii) building services systems, (iii) tenants, operators, and
    owners of the building, and (iv) current and predicted performance of the
    building from the various data sources available. The framework applies and
    specializes the existing practices in the Semantic Web, Linked Data, and
    ontology domain to the management of renovation projects. It has been
    designed to be open so that any system which implements the required
    functions and uses the specified conventions will be able to achieve
    semantic interoperability with other framework-compliant systems in the
    renovation domain. Finally, this book represents the validation process of
    the toolkit that has been held in three demo sites: a social housing
    building in Italy and two private residential buildings in Poland and
    Finland. The outcome shows that the toolkit facilitates the renovation
    process with relevant reductions of time, costs, and energy consumption and
    that the inhabitants can take advantage of the increase in building
    performances, quality, and comfort.

  abstract: >-
    This report is the result of a review commissioned by the buildingSMART

    International Regulatory Room. It explores the emerging future of automated

    rule checking (ARC). ARC is no longer just a “technical tool” needed to spot
    or

    study errors in design or work plans. Increasingly, research and
    applications of

    ARC are going beyond “box-ticking” compliance with regulatory rules. ARC is

    no longer just a cost-saving “software tool”, but a money-making “service or

    product”. Consequently, instead of the top-down, expert-system-like format,

    new forms of ARC are semantic-savvy, and are based on (bottom-up) analytics

    and machine learning approaches. ARC can now be used to automatically

    generate the analyses and/or services that consultants or contractors
    deliver.

    In fact, it can now (partially) be used to generate the design or work plans

    themselves.

    The interest in such types of ARC is a reflection of the growing importance
    and

    feasibility of AI (artificial intelligence), not just as an advanced form of

    sophisticated analysis tools, but as a driver for new business. The ability
    of

    using advanced AI approaches in these new types of ARC is a key outcome of

    the maturity of BIM in the industry. Thanks to IFC (Industry Foundation

    Classes), we now have a data-rich environment, where machine learning and

    pattern analysis can help us discover and use rules more effectively.

    Companies that master the inclusion, deployment and marketing of ARC

    capabilities will be more competitive in the new economy. Consequently, the

    “business value” of ARC is changing. It is poised to be a generator of
    services/

    products not a quality control mechanism. Increasingly, it directly
    contributes to

    realizing new segments in the market. This ranges from products for
    automated

    analyses (including the automation of designs), to products for
    customization

    and delivery of information to customers (analysis-on-demand), to enhancing

    real-time management of sites and facilities (intelligent buildings).

    However, ARC value goes beyond the automation of some technical analyses

    within a digitized system (making more software more intelligent). More

    importantly, one of the key values of advanced forms of ARC is its role in

    organizational transformation. The sophisticated considerations and cultural

    changes needed to develop and deploy an ARC make it an effective linchpin

    for enterprise-wide AI initiatives. The expertise gained from implementing

    advanced ARC can be the best testbed for wider reengineering of business

    process, automation of workflow, and the deployment of business intelligence

    within the firm (or a facility). In other words, the sophistication of ARC

    implementation will propel the re-making of the firm not just its services.
    It

    changes the firm as it changes its offerings.

    To support better understanding of this new reality, this report aims to
    frame

    the business case for ARC, with three main considerations: 1) ARC is a form
    of

    machine learning system—it is not limited to an expert system tool; 2) ARC

    includes checking rule compliance and the generation of rules through data

    analysis; 3) because of its role in assuring the transformation of
    enterprises into  the AI-savvy economy, the business case analysis should
    reflect that. The business case should not be made only based on the
    interest of a technical team (cost savings through partial automation of
    some technical processes).

    Rather, it is to be made to an executive who is considering the customer
    needs and service offering and, indeed, the future, structure and strategy
    of the firm.

    In buildingSMART International’s four summits in Barcelona, London, Paris
    and Tokyo, Regulatory Room had these days’ successful "BIM in planning and

    building permit processes seminar" and working group meetings. We had

    presentation from Building Authorities or Government Regulatory Agencies in
    many countries about what they have done so far, and what they think about
    BIM in regulatory processes in the future. It was reported that many more
    have recognized BIM and the AEC industry’s rapidly movement against more use
    of ICT tools in their processes.

    The conclusion from the meetings was that there is a need for common

    understandings were Government Regulatory Agencies together with the

    software industry and academia, can meet and share information, ideas and

    experiences and solve common issues together in the field of BIM in
    Regulatory processes.

    This guideline evaluates use case reports that introduce BIM in the process
    of

    building bSI RR meetings so far, and clarifies the development goals and key

    technologies typically required to implement BIM in the building regulatory

    process. To do so, define a common understanding of maturity and level of

    development on the following topics:

    ・ Approval step for Building Regulatory process

    ・ BIM Institutionalization stages

    ・ Level of Maturity and Development of BIM e-submission

    and Recommendations.

    We warmly express our thanks to the Contributors to the Regulatory Room
    project (who are listed in Annex 2: Contributor) and to participants in the
    Regulatory Room group and friends (who are listed in Annex 3: 'Regulatory
    Room' Group and Friends.) 

    The introduction in section 1 and the conclusions in section 5 give an
    overview, with the intervening sections go into the detailed intentions and
    discoveries. We commend this report for your attention and in particular
    section 5 and the five issues (5.3), the two recommendations (5.4) and
    sixteen actions (5.5) are detailed.


    This is a review the currently available and proposed exchange formats for
    supporting interoperability between Regulatory, Requirements and
    Recommendatory (RRR) content.

    This report aims to:

    • present a case for investigating such issues

    • identify solutions

    • propose recommendations that will be implemented by the buildingSmart
    community, by the research community and by regulatory bodies.

    In factory design projects, several disciplines such as manufacturing system
    planning must exchange design information on an ongoing basis. Due to the
    high dependencies among the disciplines, this information must be carefully
    checked. While semi-automatic methods for checking geometric information
    exist, the validation of semantic information is often done manually and
    document-based causing errors and an inefficient, laborious collaboration
    process. In order to create an expert system for BIM-based factory design
    through automatic checking of semantic information, this paper lays the
    corresponding foundation regarding (i) domain-specific validation rules and
    (ii) software implementation possibilities by using a two-round Delphi
    study.

    Manually checking models for compliance against building regulation is a
    time-consuming task for architects and construction engineers. There is thus
    a need for algorithms that process information from construction projects
    and report non-compliant elements. Still automated code-compliance checking
    raises several obstacles. Building regulations are usually published as
    human readable texts and their content is often ambiguous or incomplete.
    Also, the vocabulary used for expressing such regulations is very different
    from the vocabularies used to express Building Information Models (BIM).
    Furthermore, the high level of details associated to BIM-contained
    geometries induces complex calculations. Finally, the level of complexity of
    the IFC standard also hinders the automation of IFC processing tasks. Model
    chart, formal rules and pre-processors approach allows translating
    construction regulations into semantic queries. We further demonstrate the
    usefulness of this approach through several use cases. We argue our approach
    is a step forward in bridging the gap between regulation texts and automated
    checking algorithms. Finally with the recent building ontology BOT
    recommended by the W3C Linked Building Data Community Group, we identify
    perspectives for standardizing and extending our approach.

    the infrastructure life cycle (from the planning and design up to the
    demolition). However, some disciplines are not properly integrated within
    the workflows of BIM methodology. Therefore, the related information is not
    properly integrated in the As-Built BIM model of the infrastructure and it
    is not shared among stakeholders following BIM standards. This is the case
    of the Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control activities accomplish
    during the planning, design and construction processes of the infrastructure
    life cycle. This is the challenged tackled by the R&I project ICONYC
    developed by the Engineering Company CEMOSA, funded by the Spanish
    Government, and presented here. Geotechnical Investigation and Quality
    Control are core activities for CEMOSA. In the ICONYC project, CEMOSA has
    developed a methodology to integrate such processes within the BIM workflow
    allowing for the digital transformation of these activities. This
    presentation will describe the i) Geotechnical Investigation and Quality
    Control processes workflows; ii) the mobile apps for field data gathering
    (geotechnical drilling, surveys, inspections and samples) developed in SAP
    Fiori; iii) the apps for the information analysis (tests, incidences,
    communications, geotechnical layers, etc) developed on SAP ERP; iv) the apps
    for the generation of the Geotechnical Investigation and Quality Control BIM
    models developed by means of APIs from XBIM and Revit and, v) the Common
    Data Environment (CDE) which allows the sharing of site information
    (including documents, BIM models, CAD drawings, inspection, surveys,
    samples, incidences…) and management information (tasks, milestones,
    communications, stakeholders…) among all the participants. The CDE has been
    developed based on SAP Fiori, Autodesk BIM360 and Autodesk Forge. In
    addition, it will be described the Data Model to store on SAP ERP the
    information related to the Quality Control (batch, inspections, surveys,
    check points, samples, tests, incidences, communications, etc.) and the
    Geotechnical Investigations (drillings, samples, tests, geotechnical layers,
    etc) as well as the mapping of said Data Model with the IFC classes schema
    and the definition of the property sets to store the relevant quality
    control and geotechnical information. The integration of Geotechnical
    Investigation and Quality Control processes into the BIM methodology produce
    a more accurate As-Build BIM Model, including the actual characteristics of
    the infrastructure executed and allowing for a better traceability of the
    control processes carried out and, consequently, a greater guarantee on the
    debugging of responsibilities in possible future infrastructure ‘s
    pathologies as well as a reduction in the possible mistakes in the
    integration of geotechnical parameters and, therefore, achieving a more
    optimised foundation designs. All of this reverts in a better collaboration
    among all stakeholders in a more cost-effective way.

    Generative computation has the potential to enhance the accuracy,
    effectiveness, and creativity of spatial layout in design and planning. The
    paper proposes a methodology to separate the knowledge about objects,
    spatial relationships, and constraints from the generative process. The
    separation between the knowledge in a domain and its possible practical uses
    is an important achievement of semantic technologies, because it grants
    access to a large body of knowledge, spanning various aspects and processes
    across buildings and cities, which is being codified into formal ontologies.
    The present study has reused existing knowledge from two established
    ontologies. An illustrative case-project demonstrates the suitability of the
    methodology for a complex layout planning problem, involving a large number
    of decision-makers, with multiple competing objectives and criteria. The
    system implements multidimensional visual interactive tools to assist
    designers, planners, and decision-makers in exploring the layouts and the
    criteria, to develop their confidence in what qualifies as a good and
    effective solution.

    Building design requires different types of knowledge. However, only
    structural knowledge is explicitly represented in current Building
    Information models. Other types of knowledge, such as those related to
    functional and behavioral aspects of design, remain tacit or described in
    ad-hoc terms by relying on structural properties as representational
    surrogates (e.g. geometry). The lack of a formal, model-based representation
    of functional knowledge limits the scope of semantics required to provide
    better computational support in performance-based building design. To
    address this problem, the research proposes the development of a
    representational framework for the functional and behavioral
    characterization of building elements based on the Functional Representation
    (FR) schema, and its formalization under the DOLCE foundation ontology. Part
    of this formalization has been translated into the Web Ontology Language to
    explore capabilities of DL reasoners to support inference of functional
    interdependencies affecting performance. An overview of the main theoretical
    background adopted is provided. Preliminary results and future lines of
    research are also presented.

    The strength of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in achieving sustainable
    buildings is well recognized by the global construction industry. However,
    current understanding of the state-of-the-art green BIM research is still
    limited. In particular, a focus study on how BIM contribute to green
    building design through building performance analysis (BPA) is not
    available. This paper aims to provide systematic and comprehensive insights
    on current trends and future potentials of green BIM research by analyzing
    the existing literature with their research features (i.e. research
    backgrounds, goals, methods and outputs). In total, 80 publications have
    been collected, analyzed and discussed. The results show that among ten main
    BPA types, energy & thermal analysis, green building rating analysis, and
    cost and benefit analysis are the most studied. However, wind & ventilation
    analysis, acoustic analysis, and water efficiency analysis receive little
    attention. Moreover, more research focusing on integrated design analysis
    should be carried out for optimal design outcome. In addition, most of the
    collected literature research on the capability of data integration and
    analysis of green BIM tools, while their capability of visualization and
    documentation has limited examination. Furthermore, most researchers
    utilized one main software package while utilization of information exchange
    formats (IEF) is limited. To increase interoperability of green BIM tools,
    how different BIM authoring tools and IEFs can be utilized for BPA requires
    further investigation.

    The Industry Foundation Class (IFC) Model implemented by schema and data
    format definition in EXPRESS

    language is the industry standard for open data modeling and exchange. This
    data model, based on E-R model

    with deep object class instance hierarchy for both elements and
    relationships has presented challenges in

    implementing scalable database approaches for managing and serving BIM
    objects while maintaining

    requisite relationships necessary for inferring relationships across the
    complex E-R network. Alternative

    models based on alternative data encodings with associated data topologies,
    database strategies and

    supporting tool sets such IFCXML, IFCJSON and RDF/IFCOWL have been proposed,
    with associated

    affordances and limitations in terms of semantic richness, validation and
    querying capability and scalability.

    Graph databases are a recent development in modern databasing technology
    that is gaining prominence in

    the broader computing community. Graph databases promise general support of
    complex entity-relationship

    networks in a manner that supports rich semantic inference at scale.
    Consider those limitations stated above,

    this paper propose a method of database mapping between IFC Model to Graph
    database, and presents

    opportunities for drawing on graph querying capabilities to develop
    inferences about the semantic

    relationships among objects in IFC BIM models. The implementation and
    examination of this mapping is

    achieved by translating the IFC data and then store them into Neo4j, a
    commonly used graph database

    application. As part of this translation, broadly available IFC to XML
    conversion utilities were used to

    convert the BIM software output to XM. A python based parser was developed
    and used to parse the IFC

    component information and generate a Cypher script - the structural language
    for graph database

    construction.. This Cypher script - encapsulating the IFC E-R model is
    imported into the Neo4j graph

    database in batches with Neo4j-Shell.

    Recently owing to the increasing requirements for the improvement of
    qualitative factors of BIM-based design projects, it is necessary to develop
    an automated checking and evaluation process for the BIM data. Regulation
    information is an important factor for initial architectural design
    evaluations. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated system
    that designers and owners can check the evacuation regulation compliance of
    BIM data. In this study, the scope of applied regulation information is
    confined to evacuation regulation, as high-rise and complex building design
    has high priority and is critical on adequate disaster prevention systems
    and egress routes. To achieve this purpose, the authors have investigated
    case studies of BIM-based regulation checking process and illustrated the
    possible mechanism for the process through evacuation regulation analysis.
    Based on the presented methodology and scenario of the proposed automated
    evacuation regulation checking system, the authors developed a prototypical
    system, called InSightBIM-Evacuation.

    AbstrctIn Korea, the government has developed SEUMTER, an administration
    system for building-related public services, to facilitate and promote
    electronic submission and permission activities. SEUMTER is a progressive
    legality system based on 2D drawings for building administration permission
    services. However, there are a lot of problems related to the development of
    a legality system due to the complexity of Korean regulations, relationships
    and structures, the inefficiency of designing a legality system based on 2D
    drawings, the duplication examinations of documents (soliciting forms for
    civil affairs), and the drawings themselves. Therefore, the purpose of this
    study is to develop a legality system for building administration permission
    services based on open Building Information Modeling (BIM) in Korea. To
    achieve this purpose, the authors investigate the permission procedures and
    regulation structures used in current building administration permissions,
    then formulate an ideal permission procedure and regulation structure for
    the legality system in Korea. In addition, the authors investigate element
    technologies (for example, methods of structuring regulation, BIM model
    checker, BIM model viewer) for a legality system based on BIM and develop a
    prototypical legality checking software. Finally, the authors suggest
    strategies and future applications for a legality system based on BIM.

    Narrowing the performance deficit between design intent and the real-time
    environmental and energy performance of buildings is a complex and involved
    task, impacting on all building stakeholders. Buildings are designed, built
    and operated with increasingly complex technologies. Throughout their
    life-cycle, they produce vast quantities of data. However, many commercial
    buildings do not perform as originally intended. This paper presents a
    semantic web based approach to the performance gap problem, describing how
    heterogeneous building data sources can be transformed into semantically
    enriched information. A performance assessment ontology and performance
    framework (software tool) are introduced, which use this heterogeneous data
    as a service for a structured performance analysis. The demonstrator
    illustrates how heterogeneous data can be published semantically and then
    interpreted using a life-cycle performance framework approach.

    Building related data tends to be generated, used and retained in a
    domain-specific manner. The lack of interoperability between data domains in
    the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry inhibits the
    cross-domain use of data at an enterprise level. Semantic web technologies
    provide a possible solution to some of the noted interoperability issues.
    Traditional methods of information capture fail to take into account the
    wealth of soft information available throughout a building. Several sources
    of information are not included in performance assessment frameworks,
    including social media, occupant communication, mobile communication
    devices, occupancy patterns, human resource allocations and financial
    information. The paper suggests that improved data interoperability can aid
    the integration of untapped silos of information into existing structured
    performance measurement frameworks, leading to greater awareness of
    stakeholder concerns and building performance. An initial study of how
    building-related data can be published following semantic web principles and
    integrated with other ‘soft-data’ sources in a cross-domain manner is
    presented. The paper goes on to illustrate how data sources from outside the
    building operation domain can be used to supplement existing sources. Future
    work will include the creation of a semantic web based performance framework
    platform for building performance optimisation.

    In the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, Building
    Information Model (BIM) authoring tools enable the creation of digital
    representations of buildings. Each tool implements its own building data
    model, which makes it difficult to achieve the desired interoperability when
    building data have to be exchanged with other software (e.g., building
    energy simulation tools). The representation of BIM models through open
    standards (e.g., IFC) and Semantic Web technologies can facilitate building
    data transformation in an automated and flexible way. This is achieved by
    taking advantage of the logical basis of the Resource Description Framework
    (RDF) data model and queries created in the Semantic Web query languages.
    The result is a pragmatic mechanism to transform the data from one data
    domain to another. This article analyses the potential of Semantic Web query
    languages to facilitate the data transformation of building data through
    different alternatives. The first contribution is the identification of
    fourteen data mapping patterns and three cases of data transformation that
    enable transforming one data model into another, considering the semantic
    and structural differences between them. The second contribution is the
    review and comparison of query languages to carry out the transformations
    through two different alternatives: using SPARQL-Generate and SPARQL
    Construct queries. And finally, the third contribution is the definition of
    a metric to assess the complexity of SPARQL queries.

    Existing BIM technologies do not provide links to product components that
    are needed to facilitate the participation of manufacturers in the design
    and building processes. A deeper integration between product component
    catalogues and BIM is necessary for this purpose. Through the Linked Data
    approach, information about building products can be obtained from multiple
    sources and linked to create semantic descriptions of components that can be
    retrieved from a BIM model via component catalogues. In this article, we
    present the case of an application of Semantic Web technologies to connect
    BIM models with a catalogue of structural precast concrete components,
    carried out within the research project BAUKOM. As a proof of concept we
    have implemented a service which accesses the information provided by the
    catalogue to assist the design team in the assembly and dimensioning of
    structural components during the project phase.

    Ontologies have been great resources to share and exchange domain knowledge
    in the context of BIM. Ontologies define the logic and semantics needed for
    BIM applications by formally classifying entities in the domain including
    the types, properties, relationships and other significant attributes. One
    major benefit of using ontologies is that the information and knowledge
    defined with these ontologies can be shared across the various BIM
    applications without divulging proprietary information. However, major
    challenges exist with sharing and reuse of information due to the lack of
    consistency, redundancy, and potential errors. This chapter explores the
    development of ontologies, languages, and standards to highlight the
    applications and deployments of shared representations of building
    information models. The objectives include: 1) present an overview of
    knowledge management in a BIM context, including the status of available
    standards and data exchange approaches; 2) explain the details of ontology
    components and the Semantic Web stack, 3) discuss the development, reusage,
    and management of ontologies; 4) present current AEC ontologies that can be
    integrated with BIM be discussed; and 5) reflect on the limitations and open
    challenges regarding BIM and ontologies to promote future research. Major
    findings highlighted in this chapter include i) perfectly interoperable
    integrated systems will never be fully achieved since interoperability
    between systems and data structures always need to be made, in which those
    mappings always come with ‘interpretation errors’ or ‘data loss’, ii)
    integrating BIM tools with other data sets predominantly including time
    series databases (sensor data), GIS data, and complex 3D data, into a single
    data storage system is neither efficient nor desirable, and iii) BIM and
    digital twin applications needs support from Semantic Web and linked data.
    Significantly, recent research and developments suggest that BIM, even with
    current challenges, will expand to utilization that is yet to be envisioned.

    Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) Industry has seen an increase
    in the amount of computer software, technologies, and automation to help
    improve all facets of the industry. This new era of technologies is enabling
    transformative change in the way our communities are interacting among
    themselves and with the built environment. The Internet of Things (IoT),
    cyber infrastructure, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are among
    the new transformative changes that produce and share information from all
    the connected devices and technologies enabling Smart Cities and Intelligent
    Jobsites. With the increase of such innovations, seamless information
    exchange between the connected technologies within the different domain
    facets is a major need. The purpose of this workshop was to provide a
    focused overview on technical and applied research on the usage of semantic
    web, linked data, and web of data technologies for the AECO industry. The
    workshop aimed at gathering researchers, industry stakeholders, and

    Digital transformation is driving a new wave of large-scale datafication in
    every aspect of our world. Today our society creates data ecosystems where
    data moves among actors within complex information supply chains that can
    form around an organization, community, sector, or smart environment. These
    ecosystems of data can be exploited to transform our world and present new
    challenges and opportunities in the design of intelligent systems. This talk
    presents my recent work on using the dataspace paradigm as a best-effort
    approach to data management within data ecosystems. The talk explores the
    theoretical foundations and principles of dataspaces and details a set of
    specialized best-effort techniques and models to enable loose administrative
    proximity and semantic integration of heterogeneous data sources. Finally, I
    share my perspectives on future dataspace research challenges, including
    multimedia data, data governance and the role of dataspaces to enable
    large-scale data sharing within Europe to power data-driven AI.

    Scan-to-BIM is the process of converting a 3D reconstruction into a building
    information model (BIM). The process has two parts: (1) sorting subsets of
    the reconstruction into classes (semantic segmentation) defined by a BIM
    taxonomy and (2) identifying geometric parameters describing each class
    instance. Here we demonstrate the ability of deep learning artificial neural
    networks to semantically segment images of building facilities. We found
    this deep learning approach capable of simultaneously recognizing: ceiling,
    wall, plumbing, duct, door, floor, and stairs classes. This semantic scope
    surpasses state-of-the-art building system recognition methods and
    represents progress towards comprehensive BIM creation.

    One of the characteristic features of object-based Building Information
    Models is the close integration of geometric and semantic information into
    one model. This concept is thoroughly implemented by the Industry Foundation
    Classes (IFC), a comprehensive data model designed to provide a sound
    foundation for complex data exchange scenarios. Besides the provision of a
    large variety of data types for capturing the semantics of building elements
    and spaces, the IFC also makes it possible to define relationships between
    building elements and/or spaces, respectively. In particular, a spatial
    aggregation hierarchy can be modeled by successively applying the
    relationship IfcRelAggregates to space objects. However, no validation
    options currently exist to check whether the semantically defined
    aggregation hierarchy complies with the geometric setup of the individual
    spaces and building elements. This lack of consistency between the semantic
    and the geometric part of the BIM model may lead to serious data
    interpretation errors at the receiving end. To prevent this, we propose a
    new method for validating spatio-semantic consistency based on the usage of
    the Query Language for Building Information Models (QL4BIM) which on the one
    hand provides a means of accessing the IFC object model and on the other
    hand provides high-level spatial operators, such as Disjoint, Touching and
    Containing. The formulation of corresponding queries makes it possible to
    verify the spatio-semantic consistency of the IFC model. The paper discusses
    application scenarios and provides a number of relevant examples.

    Distinct semantic-geometric data models are applied in
    architecture/engineering/construction and geospatial domains. However, to
    make decisions within complex urban planning and engineering tasks these two
    domains and their data models must be combinded. Currently, the necessary
    joint information is created by converting data between the two domains.
    Because the employed modelling differs conceptually, there is a high risk of
    information loss durring these conversions. To overcome this issue, we
    present a spatio-semantic query language that allows analysis of IFC
    building information models and geospatial CityGML models in an integrated
    context. Rather than converting between IFC and CityGML, a holistic
    information space is realized by an intermediate layer that abstracts from
    the two schemas of spatio-semantic modelling.

    Building designs in the UK are currently checked manually against a
    frequently changing and increasingly complex set of building regulations.
    This is a major task for both designers and enforcers, often leading to
    ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall
    construction process. Technical developments in Building Information
    Modelling (BIM) offer the potential for a new generation of software tools
    that can automate the checking of compliance with building codes, thus
    improving the efficiency of building design and procurement. To attain these
    efficiencies designers must change their working practices and move away
    from the definition of a building in multiple and disparate documents to a
    single coherent building model from which the documentation is generated.
    Theoretically, this building model could contain sufficient information to
    respond to interrogation at the level of building code compliance, though in
    practice only a percentage of the required information is normally present.
    This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance,
    identifies the key issues for future development and examines the causes of
    information paucity for compliance checking in the current generation of BIM
    tools.

    The management and the identification of design changes constitute an
    essential part of the of a design flow within the architecture, engineering
    and construction (AEC) industry, requiring the formalisation of a
    multi-disciplinary collaborative information modelling environment.
    Construction projects generate substantial amount of change information,
    which needs to be updated continuously throughout the process, from initial
    feasibility study to the decommissioning of facilities. Complications arise
    from the information storage in multiple incompatible file formats that can
    lead to the loss or omission of details.

    In addition to any unexpected changes, the mismanagement of information is
    another factor leading to delays and costly errors. In order to mitigate
    such issues, this paper proposes to integrate the Industry Foundation
    Classes (IFC) data model and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate
    and visually identify the result of change requests. The system is developed
    using C# by 1) integrating angular framework with ASP.NET (Active Server
    Pages) to create a dynamic single web page and 2). Using X-BIM toolkit that
    supports IFC format to read, create and visualise the BuildingSmart Data
    Models (aka IFC Models). This approach enables a web-based platform capable
    of generating reports and visual previews, highlighting the differences
    between IFC files throughout the design processes.

    A web-based system prototype allows users to compare subsequent versions of
    IFC design models in terms of additions, modifications and deletions. The
    prototype uses NLP to intelligently identify the changes that have been made
    as it compares newer and older versions of the same model, making this
    information available to designers and 3D modellers.

    Prospective work will focus on the application of artificial intelligence
    (AI) to automate the implementation of changes within the construction
    models.

    The widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the
    recent emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications offer several new
    insights and decision-making capabilities throughout the life cycle of the
    built environment. In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to
    online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the
    concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to
    achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for
    seamless management and control of the construction process, facility
    management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the
    built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built
    environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand
    the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a
    convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a
    systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies
    facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment
    applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were
    selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed
    studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system
    based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in
    Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were
    further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction
    process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In
    addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins
    was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of
    the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized
    the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the
    earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and
    the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced
    Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies.

    In recent years, reduction of energy consumption in buildings has
    increasingly gained interest among researchers mainly due to practical
    reasons, such as economic advantages and long-term environmental
    sustainability. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature to
    address this important issue from complementary perspectives, which are
    often hard to capture in a comprehensive manner. This survey article aims at
    providing a structured and unifying treatment of the existing literature on
    intelligent energy management systems in buildings, with a distinct focus on
    available architectures and methodology supporting a vision transcending the
    well-established smart home vision, in favor of the novel Ambient
    Intelligence paradigm. Our exposition will cover the main architectural
    components of such systems, beginning with the basic sensory infrastructure,
    moving on to the data processing engine where energy-saving strategies may
    be enacted, to the user interaction interface subsystem, and finally to the
    actuation infrastructure necessary to transfer the planned modifications to
    the environment. For each component, we will analyze different solutions,
    and we will provide qualitative comparisons, also highlighting the impact
    that a single design choice can have on the rest of the system.

    This paper presents a working methodology for the automatic generation of
    as-built Building Information Models (BIMs) including shade surfaces able to
    be subjected to solar analysis, given the great effect that shading has in
    the energy consumption of the building. This methodology goes from data
    acquisition with a laser scanner, to the shape extraction of the building
    and its surroundings from the acquired data through curvature analysis and
    Region Growing algorithms, to end with the conversion of the extracted
    elements, which define both the building and the shading elements, to BIM
    components. BIM is defined in gbXML language, which was especially designed
    to be used in energy software, so that the generated BIM with shades can be
    directly introduced in energy analysis software.

    The construction sector is a project-based industry characterised by
    informative-intensive processes. Project information is composed by several
    documents among which graphical drawings traditionally represent a
    fundamental component. The fragmentation of this information along the
    construction process can be addressed with the use of Building Information
    Modelling (BIM). One of the fundamental components of BIM is the development
    of information models. These models contain a defined and shared semantic
    structure that allows the simulation of real entities in a digital
    environment. However, the quality of this simulation is bounded by the
    limits of the instruments used for its development. The work presented in
    this paper is the development a rules-based system that makes inference upon
    ontologies obtained from IFC models to recognise real estates units and
    their destination of uses starting from building information models. The
    proposed application aims to overcome the limits imposed by the IFC schema
    focusing both the reasoning process and the resulting enriching information
    on ontologies.

    There has been an extensive amount of research conducted internationally
    over the last four decades in the area of automated and semi-automated
    regulatory compliance checking for the Architecture, Engineering, and
    Construction (AEC) industry. This paper summarises the earlier research
    initiatives, explores common themes and different approaches used, as well
    as comparing the strengths and limitations of a number of major code
    compliance checking tools. Some of these tools have been implemented
    commercially and others are beginning to be adopted or are in their final
    stages of development. The paper also examines how readily these tools can
    be applied in the context of a performance-based code as found in New
    Zealand. Due to a recent push for innovation and productivity improvement in
    the AEC industry, there is an increased uptake of building information
    modelling (BIM) and the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) open standard data
    model for interoperability. The availability of high performance personal
    computers, efficient web-based technology, and new initiatives in legal
    knowledge representation modelling should make the development of commercial
    compliance checking systems more viable than ever. However, the quest for an
    industry agreed unified approach seems to be far from over. Research is
    being conducted to develop a computer interpretable representation of New
    Zealand’s performance-based codes using an open standard legal data exchange
    protocol. This is to be integrated into a web-based BIM compliance checking
    framework. The fire safety clauses of the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC)
    are used in the case study.

    The progressive uptake of ISO-standard BIM (Building Information Modelling)
    in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facilities Management
    (AEC/FM) industry in recent years has started to make common building
    information accessible to all project stakeholders and processes. Building
    Consent Authorities (BCA) are exploring how to take advantage of the
    benefits provided by BIM for automating some of the laborious and repetitive
    compliance auditing tasks that are part of the core consenting process. This
    paper describes a proof-of-concept project undertaken in conjunction with a
    BCA in New Zealand to identify requirements for implementing and to assess
    the industry’s readiness for the BIM-based consenting process. An automated
    compliance audit tool, ACABIM, was used in the project. The findings of the
    project suggest that there is a clear indication of productivity, efficiency
    and analytical benefits gain. The main outcome of the project is

    a document specifying the minimum data requirements for BIM-based consent
    submission.

    Two common challenges in the computer-aided compliance audit of building
    engineering designs are addressed in the current research. The first is to
    ensure that any form of computable representation is practical and
    relatively easy to use and maintain. The second is to ensure that
    performance-based regulatory compliance criteria, which are often
    qualitative in nature, are adequately addressed and correctly represented.
    This research proposes a method of automating manual compliant design
    procedures using an open standard executable workflow representation that
    can be specified and maintained relatively easily by a design engineer. This
    executable workflow is referred to as the compliant design procedure (CDP)
    and can be described graphically. When executed in a computing environment,
    a CDP can guide the compliance audit process by checking a given design
    represented in a model view or subset of the building information model
    (BIM), referred to as the building compliance model (BCM), against the
    criteria in a digital building code, referred to as the regulatory knowledge
    model (RKM), which is developed specifically for this purpose. This paper
    describes the process of modeling and encoding BCM, CDP, and RKM, which are
    independent input components of the proposed compliance audit system
    framework. Supplementary human input and the ability to exchange input and
    output data with external simulation tools to solve some of the more complex
    qualitative criteria are important features of the framework.

    Legal text is typically conveyed in natural language and thus not readily
    suitable for computer processing. Numerous work-around approaches have been
    proposed by researchers in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and
    Facilities Management (AEC/FM) domain over the last four decades to create
    computable representations of normative data that can be used to automate
    some of the processes in the domain. The transition from human-readable text
    to a structured representation can occur in many possible ways, eg through
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, manual annotations, or through
    direct coding. In all cases, however, the human-readable document at the
    source remains the sole point of reference. Ideally, however, one digital
    structured representation should also be available and recognised as the
    single digital point of reference. Research in the AEC/FM domain has shown
    that automated compliant building design processes would benefit from a
    single standardised and manageable digital representation of normative data.
    Recent efforts in the legal domain have shown promising developments in
    legal mark-up languages such as LegalDocML and LegalRuleML as emerging open
    standards for legal knowledge interchange. In this article, we explore the
    potential of adapting these emerging standards to accommodate specific
    requirements of the AEC/FM domain.

    The ingredients for an effective automated audit of a building design
    include a building model containing the design information, a computerised
    regulatory knowledge model, and a practical method of processing these
    computable representations. There have been numerous approaches to
    computer-aided compliance audit in the AEC/FM domain over the last four
    decades, but none has yet evolved into a practical solution. One reason is
    that they have all been isolated attempts that lack any form of
    industry-wide standardisation. The current research project, therefore,
    focuses on investigating the use of the industry standard building
    information model and the adoption of open standard legal knowledge
    interchange and executable workflow models for automating conventional
    compliant design processes. This paper provides a non-exhaustive overview of
    common approaches to model and access regulatory knowledge for a compliance
    audit. The strengths and weaknesses of two comparative open standard
    knowledge representation approaches are discussed using an example
    regulatory document.

    standardisation. The current research project therefore focuses on using an
    open standard regulatory knowledge and BIM representations in conjunction
    with open standard executable compliant design workflows to automate the
    compliance audit process. This paper provides an overview of different
    approaches to access information from a regulatory model representation. The
    paper then describes the use of a purpose-built high-level domain specific
    query language to extract regulatory information as part of the effort to
    automate manual design procedures for compliance audit.

  abstract: >-
    The main challenges in automating the regulatory compliance checking of
    building engineering designs are the availability of computable
    representations of the building and the regulatory knowledge, as well as a
    system that can process and manage these representations effectively. The
    emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Industry Foundation
    Classes (IFC) at the start of the millennium has sparked useful research in
    the area of sharing building information effectively; but, challenges remain
    with producing a practical and manageable regulatory knowledge
    representation that can be processed effectively by a compliance checking
    system. Research is being conducted to develop a two-part regulatory
    knowledge representation which can be maintained independently by designers
    and regulators. One part is a set of compliant design procedures modelled as
    Business Process Diagrams (BPD) using an open standard Business Process
    Model and Notation (BPMN). The other part is the associated regulatory
    constraints and rules encoded in a computable format suitable for execution
    with the BPMN. This paper reports on a set of guidelines developed for the
    purposes of encoding regulatory knowledge into the proposed computable
    representation. A verification method (C/VM2) prescribed by the New Zealand
    Building Code (NZBC) for the performance-based design of buildings related
    to fire safety has been selected as a case study to illustrate the encoding
    process. These guidelines are adaptable for encoding the entire NZBC.

  abstract: >-
    Occupant-centric decision-making in buildings requires integrating occupant
    information with other building information. Semantic web technologies
    promise to reduce data interoperability issues. However, methods to discover
    occupants’ experiences and integrate those with linked building data are
    scarce. This paper aims to show how combining knowledge discovery in
    databases and semantic web technology could lead to an improved
    understanding of occupants’ experiences in buildings. This approach is
    applied to a case study using the Open Family Home. An occupant collected
    feedback on various comfort indicators using a smartwatch app. Building
    information, sensor data, weather data, and occupant information and
    feedback were integrated into a cross-domain semantic digital twin. A Python
    script collected all the data from the digital twin and ran a data analysis,
    after which parameters that affected the occupant’s experience were
    collected. The results were transformed into triples and integrated with the
    linked building data. This combination of knowledge discovery in databases
    and semantic web technologies results in enriched digital twins that can be
    used for occupant-centric decision-making. The approach presented in this
    study was generalized into a four-step method that can be applied at a
    variety of use-cases in the architecture, engineering, and construction
    domain.

    Higher building performance saves operational costs, helps sustaina-bility
    goals, and increases the comfort, satisfaction, productivity, and health of
    occupants. However, models simulating the occupants’ perceived performance
    of indoor environments require highly heterogeneous input data. This paper
    aims to show how semantic web technologies can help to overcome problems
    deriving from this heterogeneity issue. Literature is studied to categorize
    the necessary input information for modeling occupants’ perceived building
    performance. Two perspectives were consulted, namely the Indoor
    Environmental Quality approach and the Healing Environments approach. Based
    on the results, a core IEQ data model, integrating building topology, static
    properties, and dynamic properties, is proposed. We introduced a method to
    integrate this information by using the Building Performance Ontology (BOP).
    This method was tested by manually transforming the Open Smart Home (OSH)
    data to BOP vocabulary. Time-series data from various sensors were stored in
    InfluxDB and connected to the linked building data. A custom-built python
    tool was created to compute the thermal comfort of the OSH using the PMV/PPD
    method. The results indicate that a com-mon data structure for static and
    dynamic properties helps to integrate the heter-ogeneity input data.
    Furthermore, we showed that adding occupants’ data or sys-tem information
    could improve thermal comfort through multiple reactive ap-proaches.

    This paper surveys rule checking systems that assess building designs
    according to various criteria. We examine five major industrial efforts in
    detail, all relying on IFC building models as input. The functional
    capabilities of a rule checking system are organized into four stages; these
    functional criteria provide a framework for comparisons of the five systems.
    The review assesses both the technology and structure of building design
    rule checking, as an assessment of this new emerging field. The development
    of rule checking systems for building is very young and only limited user
    experience is presented. The survey lays out a framework for considering
    research needed for this area to mature.

    The AEC industry is highly regulated by a large number of rules given by
    public laws, codes, andregulative standards at both national and
    international levels. The relevant information in thesedocuments need to be
    captured as rules for model checking in a time and cost effective way.
    Thefoundation for the RASE concept is using mark-up based on the four
    operators; requirement (R),applicabilities (A), selection (S) and exceptions
    (E) on normative text. The RASE technology has beentested on following three
    categories of documents: standard (case: NS 11001-1.E:2009 Universaldesign
    of building constructions - Part 1: Work buildings and buildings open to the
    public), standardswith tables (Dubai regulations) and guidelines (case: GSA
    court design guidance document, USA). Ineach case expectations have been
    documented using free prose. On examination, the key clauses and phrases can
    be identified along with their role, allowing a testable, logical statement
    to be generated.The logical statement is then ready to be used by a
    compliance-checking engine to apply tests to adescription of the facility.
    The results indicate that the RASE methodology can operate on a
    differenttypes of normative documents with a trustworthy results.

    Abstract As Building Information Modeling evolves into becoming the central
    mean for coordinating project design and planning activities, we notice a
    few limitations/opportunities in the way current BIM tools address the needs
    for integrated design, collaboration and analysis (the initial objective of
    BIM). First, substantial communications and interactions about the design
    exist outside the BIM environment — typically in e-mail formats. This may
    cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste valuable
    knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need of engaging
    end-users and their keen interest in selecting “green” features.
    Professionals can develop different designs that achieve varying levels of
    energy conservation, but these will always require changes based on usage
    patterns. So, it is important that end-users are involved in the design
    process early on to make sure that they receive adequate information/
    education before they make decisions. This is the nature of limitations that
    we try to address in this research. This paper builds around the design and
    development of an online system, named Green2.0 that tries to leverage
    advancements in Building Information Models (BIM), energy-efficiency
    simulation tools, and online social network analysis methods to enable a
    data-driven approach to building planning, construction and maintenance.
    Fundamentally, it allows participants (end-users or professionals) to
    comment and share views about building designs. Social network analysis and
    semantic modeling tools are then used to extract information from these
    interactions. At the same time, it connects BIM to energy analysis software
    to allow users to select different products from a catalog and assess the
    impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to advance the
    current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way
    that AEC professionals, end-users and public policy makers work together
    throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an open platform, it provides
    access to information that enables researchers and practitioners to build
    new, more efficient theories and methods of building design. The premise of
    our work is that by providing new insights into the building design process
    it is likely to have a profound beneficial effect for both AEC professionals
    and the society at large.

  abstract: >-
    With the increasing demands for domain-wide integrated construction and
    infrastructure development, there is a need for developing a domain ontology
    to build a knowledge model that describes the multistakeholder project
    development process. This paper presents a domain ontology for supporting
    knowledge-enabled process management and coordination across various
    stakeholders, disci-plines, and projects. The ontological model is composed
    of concepts, relations, and axioms. Concepts represent the "things" in the
    domain of interest; relations establish the interconcept links; and axioms
    specify the definitions of concepts and relations and constraints on their
    behavior and interpretation. The ontology models the most fundamental
    concepts in the domain in a structured, extendable, and flexible format to
    facilitate future evolution and extension of the ontology for representing
    application-specific and/or enterprise-specific knowl-edge. The ontology was
    evaluated through technical evaluation and user evaluation. User evaluation
    was conducted through one-to-one expert evaluation interviews.

  abstract: >-
    In the building industry, disciplines have specific requirements for
    capturing, storing and representing information. As a result, one physical
    object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to
    describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design
    differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be
    integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability
    problems between different software often hinders data integration. This
    paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in
    centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application
    examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and
    interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the
    interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share
    information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and
    suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this
    paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support
    collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by
    modular disciplinary ontolo-gies, can provide a solid ground to share and
    exchange data flexibly.

    Towards Better Co-Design with Disciplinary Ontologies: Review and evaluation

  abstract: >-
    Architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) projects require
    multidisciplinary solutions; therefore, one physical asset results in
    several disciplinary representations. Interoperability problems between
    different software often hinder disciplinary data integration, which
    prevents the recognition of violated design constraints until it is too
    late. The open-source platform Building Habitat object Model (BHoM)
    integrates many AEC concepts across existing languages and platforms,
    allowing multiple discrete disciplinary representations of buildings. The
    Linked Building Data Community Group of the World Wide Web Consortium uses
    Semantic Web standards to store and share data. This paper explores and
    presents methods to recast BHoM's object model as a knowledge graph using
    Semantic Web standards. It analyzes BHoM in an ontological context by
    elaborating on its approach to object-oriented programming and comparing it
    to the Semantic Web standards. Furthermore, it presents BHoM RDF prototypes
    as a potential solution to the interoperability problem of multidisciplinary
    design in AEC. It also exemplifies these BHoM RDF prototypes on a small
    demonstrator project. When combined with Semantic Web standards, the BHoM
    framework can increase the use of knowledge graphs in the AEC industry,
    improving data interoperability and assisting design decisions through
    reasoning.

    The aim of this paper is to present a proposal for a national building
    standard in Sweden. We define requirements for the proposed standard, e.g.,
    it should support development of 3D city models, connect to building
    information models (BIM) and national registers and be based on a national
    classification system for the urban environment. Based on these requirements
    we develop an Application Domain Extension (ADE) of the building model in
    the proposed CityGML 3.0 standard denoted CityGML Sve-Test. CityGML 3.0
    includes several new features of interest, e.g., the space concept, enhanced
    possibilities to convert data, and to link to other standards. In our study
    we create test data according to CityGML Sve-Test and evaluate it against
    the requirements. It is shown that BIM models (in Industry Foundation
    Classes, IFC, format) can be converted to CityGML Sve-Test and that a
    classification system facilitates this conversion. The CityGML Sve-Test
    dataset can be used to increase the automation level in building permissions
    checking and a related study shows that CityGML 3.0 has capabilities to link
    to legal information and be a base for 3D cadastral index maps. Based on our
    experience, we suggest that the national building standard should conform to
    international standards and, if possible, include a classification system.
    The exchange format (GML, JSON etc.) might change, but to be based on a
    standardized data model ensures harmonized structures and concepts.

    Since we spend most of our time within buildings it is of utmost importance
    to feel comfortable while staying indoors. However, research shows that HVAC
    systems only ensure occupants satisfaction in the 11% of the commercial
    buildings. The advancing spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the
    maturity of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) may contribute to develop
    accurate predictive models which address this challenge. But data analysts
    in charge of developing these predictive models may feel overwhelmed if they
    have insufficient domain expertise. In this article, the ontology-driven
    approach proposed by the EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic
    Assistant) is presented, in which data analysts can benefit from previously
    captured domain knowledge to get support regarding which are the variables
    to consider when developing a model which accurately predicts the thermal
    comfort within buildings. Compared with the existing tools or methods, the
    EEPSA is able to suggest variables that may not necessarily be included in
    the set of data available. This fact has a big potential nowadays, where the
    Linked Open Data and the third-party repositories are valuable sources of
    knowledge which can be exploited to incorporate relevant information to the
    set of data available.

    Like in many other domains in the construction industry, concepts and
    methods of Building Information Modeling (BIM) are becoming more and more
    important for the design of civil infrastructure assets. Although several
    data formats have been developed to capture domainspecific data, none of
    these schemas can be used for holistic communication and cross-domain data
    exchange. In this paper, we present approaches for mapping existing
    domain-specific data formats in a more generic schema like the Industry
    Foundation Classes (IFC). This offers the possibility to develop
    coordination models for seamless data exchange and improved communication
    between project stakeholders.

    The application of suitable data structures is an essential aspect for novel
    digital workflows in engineering and design processes of the Architectural,
    Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Since model-based data
    exchange gets increasingly adopted by the industry, feasible and more
    effective methods must be considered to improve data exchange in the future.
    While the concept of federated model integration and container-based
    collaboration as demanded by ISO19650 is well established and widely
    adopted, it shows a number of deficiencies, in particular when it comes to
    consistency preservation across the domain models and the handling of design
    updates. Current practice relies on the exchange of complete domain models
    which requires the manual identification of design changes by all other
    stakeholders. Consistency is checked merely by collision detection, which
    however can cover only geometric aspects. To overcome these limitations,
    this paper proposes a comprehensive system architecture as well as
    techniques to identify updates in models and federate such update
    information by means of update patches. To this end, specific focus is put
    on possible mechanisms to detect changes and to integrate update patches in
    the receiving application.

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers the potential to transform our lives in
    radical ways. However, not only do we lack the tools to determine what
    achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even underestimate
    what various technologies in AI are capable of today. Certainly, the
    translation from scientific papers and benchmark performance to products is
    faster in AI than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is often the
    case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology
    that is ready to use in real-world environments. This document describes an
    example-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies,
    by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (e.g., maturity and
    availability levels). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI
    and identify different categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We
    then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness-vs-generality
    charts, where we see that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality
    technologies focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while low TRLs are
    still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous
    examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields, and show their
    readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as a base for a broader discussion
    of AI technologies. Finally, we use the dynamics of several AI technology at
    different generality levels and moments of time to forecast some short-term
    and mid-term trends for AI.

    In the Building Information Modeling world, compliance checking of IFC
    models is an immense challenge. Many approaches such as Hard Coded Rule
    Checking, Query based Rule Checking, Rule Checking Approaches via dedicated
    rule languages (SWRL, Jess, N3Logic, etc., are being contributed to fulfil
    these requirements. In this paper, we present our research and development
    of Semantic BIM Reasoner (SBIM-Reasoner) tool for measuring and ensuring
    conformance of IFC models. SBIM-Reasoner implements multi-threading approach
    for embedding semantic querying and rule based approach for developing
    French building code compliance system. Various pre-processors (IFC2RDF
    Converter, Geometry Extractor, Rule Evaluator, etc.) run in different
    execution threads to build the underlying semantic repository providing
    faster rule checking and information retrieval from the triple store. When
    it finds non-compliant objects in the IFC model, it presents them to the
    end-user. With the knowledge graph over triplets, we have the freedom of
    extending our semantic IFC model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation
    of newer rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with conditions and
    constraints over IFC data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the
    initial data of IFC model, etc. We present encouraging results by various
    tests which were build using online IFC test models of various sizes and
    designs to test the performance of SBIM-Reasoner.

    Building codes are the rules and guidelines that specify the minimum
    acceptable level of safety, accessibility, general welfare, etc. of building
    models. Code compliance checking of building models requires precise
    identification or estimation of the real-world geographic location of IFC
    objects. Geolocation based on Bounding Boxes is a very simple technique
    defined by minimum and maximum longitudes and latitudes. In this paper, we
    discuss that bounding box technique cannot help precise identification of
    IFC objects and does not fulfill all our requirements of code compliance
    checking. Therefore, we have to go beyond bounding boxes and analyze
    Well-known Text format for the precise identification of data objects in the
    building model. Well-Known Text is a text markup language for representing
    vector geometry objects on a map and offers a precise and compact machine
    and human-readable representation of geometric objects. We explored two
    geospatial tools (Stardog and GraphDB) for working with Well-known Text and
    illustrate various examples narrating their similarities and differences on
    various test cases. Both the tools implement several extensions to ease
    queries for processing geospatial data. These Geo-SPARQL extentions are
    designed to accommodate systems based on qualitative spatial reasoning and
    systems based on quantitative spatial computations.

    Nowadays, it is a hot challenge to address automatic verification
    requirements to warn the non-conformities with the associated 3D

    given digital model based on its sophisticated contextual information. In
    this paper, we contribute a framework for mapping certification rules over
    BIM to enable the compliance checking of the repository through the digital
    building model. Our aim is to align several specialized indexations of
    building components at both sides, by extending IfcOWL ontology with bSDD
    vocabulary (i.e., synonyms and description) as enriched eIfcOWL ontology to
    deal with the same abstract concepts or physical objects. Finally, we
    present and compare MVDXML and SWRL technologies for the model instance
    verification and conformance checking of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
    models, and demonstrate various important aspects and their limitation.

    Recent years have witnessed the development of various techniques and tools
    for the building code-compliance of IFC models. Indeed these are great
    efforts, but, still there is a gap for the fully automatic building
    code-compliance. This paper presents our research and development of
    Semantic BIM Reasoner (SBIM-Reasoner) which employs semantic technologies to
    meet the requirements of semantic verification of an IFC model.
    SBIM-Reasoner employs several preprocessors (IFC to RDF converter, Geometry
    Extractor) to build the semantic repository from the input IFC model. Once
    all the triples are generated from the initial data (.ifc file), Stardog is
    used to build a knowledge graph for the semantic verification. All types of
    inference and reasoning mechanisms for the semantic verification are applied
    over this knowledge graph to meet the requirements of verification.
    Knowledge graph over triplets enables freedom of extending RDF based
    Semantic IFC model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation of newer
    rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with condition and
    constraints over IFC data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the
    initial data of IFC model, etc. Finally, we tested our prototype by using
    several online IFC models. We conclude that semantic technologies provide
    more rich mechanisms and answer vast types of queries for the verification
    of IFC models. It provides powerful features based on SPARQL libraries and
    serves best for the automated code compliance and verification of IFC
    models.

    In the last decade, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been of broad
    and great interest in both the academia and industry. Massive amounts of BIM
    researches have been published in academic journals, books and conference
    proceedings. However, more than half of the published researches are not
    cited, and some researches with similar questions and outputs are published.
    In this research, the Linked Data paradigm is utilized with ontologies to
    provide a structured database of the different articles of BIM and mapped to
    different BIM aspects in a semantically meaningful format. The proposed
    ontologies and Linked Data can accelerate and enhance systematic reviews and
    metadata analysis for future BIM studies. Also, it can assist young
    researchers to define the gaps that need to be filled in BIM studies and
    avoid repetitive researches.

    Over the recent years, there has been a growing interest in how Building
    Information Modelling (BIM) can facilitate effective Asset Management (AM).
    BIM-AM data integration has come with issues related to establishing an
    effective process to extract, store, and distribute data to ensure
    interoperability. Several information exchange specifications such as COBie
    and SPARKie have been developed to enable effective interoperability for
    better building assets operation and maintenance. Due to asset
    heterogeneity, the exchange models cannot be generalised and applied to all
    assets systems. Exchange models need to be developed for particular asset
    systems based on their functionality and building type. In order to
    contribute to overcoming the BIM-AM interoperability challenge, this study
    aims to provide the required semantic and syntactic interoperability aspects
    for the data exchange of assets that consume energy from the BIM systems to
    the AM systems during the handover stage.

  title: Semantic and syntactic interoperability of BIM and asset management data
  type: paper-conference

  abstract: >-
    At present, the capability to collect information from different sources
    [building information modeling (BIM), sensors, assets database] for asset
    management (AM) use has generated significant opportunities for asset owners
    and facility managers. BIM, in particular, is considered as a potentially
    effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the
    building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder
    data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the
    handover stage. However, this data integration in a BIM environment has
    issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract,
    store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability.
    Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the
    identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add
    value to the AM processes. This research explored the asset owner
    requirements from BIM in the operation and maintenance stage from an AM
    perspective. The research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the
    nongeometric BIM data required for AM and develop a relevant taxonomy; and
    second, to develop an application programming interface (API) plug-in for
    Autodesk Revit to implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of
    this study, a critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and
    focus group interviews with BIM and facilities management (FM) experts were
    conducted. The main output was a 60-parameter asset-consuming energy
    information management (ACE-IM) taxonomy and the relevant API plug-in that
    can help BIM professionals to identify the required data to be submitted to
    facility managers to improve AM processes.

    In this paper, we present a novel approach called IfcView that relies on
    Semantic Web technologies for creating building views. To do so, we consider
    an ifcOWL ontology proposed by buildingSMART. The ifcOWL is an Industry
    Foundation Classes (IFC) based ontology. By combining the ifcOWL ontology
    with logical rules (expressed in Semantic Web Rule Language, SWRL), we
    demonstrate through several case studies that our approach can perform a
    more intuitive and flexible extraction of building views when compared to
    the Model View Definition (MVD) approach. This is because our rule-based
    approach dynamically creates sub-graphs (i.e. views) by specifying the IFC
    elements to extract as Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID), relationships or
    entities. Another benefit of our approach is the fact that it simplifies the
    maintenance and definition of building views. Once our rule-based system
    extracts such a building view (i.e. sub-graph), this view can be exported by
    using STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product) or Turtle (a Resource
    Description Framework (RDF) syntax) formats.

    In the area of building construction and management, the dematerial-ization
    of data and processes has been a global issue for the past 10 years. Go-ing
    beyond the geometric representation of a building, Building Information
    Modeling (BIM) is an approach that aims at integrating into one single
    system heterogeneous data and processes from different actors. Such
    integration is a complex and fastidious task. The implementation of the
    related processes for data querying, retrieval or modification is not less
    difficult. To tackle this prob-lem, we have developed a novel approach based
    on Semantic Web technolo-gies. In doing so, we have defined an ontology
    inspired on IFC standard for rep-resenting building information. On top of
    this ontology, we have defined and implemented a set of SWRL rules. The
    paper at hand describes these rules and their application in the context of
    building information handling (notably by means of IFC files)

    To implement BIM models successfully in an established procedural
    environment it is necessary to understand the current state of processes and
    their influences. Significant decisions are necessary until building
    permitability is determined. Automated model checking can only help with a
    certain number of regulations, which have quantitative content with
    measurable parameters. Regulations containing qualitative content still
    require manual reviewing by the authority. Detailed processes regarding
    decision making are currently not investigated or published. Building permit
    processes differ even within the authorities of a state or a country and
    have been mostly developed traditionally. A decision model is proposed as a
    decision-supporting instrument which shows the authorities’ reviewer
    possibilities and alternatives of actions during a building permit review.
    This procedure aims at more transparency and objectivity. The proposed
    approach provides a starting point for implementing and using BIM. It also
    serves as a basis for further research in an international context of
    standardization of building permitting.

  abstract: >-
    Without a building permit, a construction project cannot be legally
    implemented. For this, the building project must undergo a review process by
    the competent authority. As the number of building projects to be inspected
    increases, building authorities are faced with ever greater challenges, due
    to the lack of adequate personnel to manage the inefficient, labor
    extensive, and lengthy building permit process. In-depth scientific studies
    of the existing building permit processes are missing so far. This paper
    introduces a proposed framework that aims to investigate and compare the
    building permit processes in Germany and in the United States of America
    (USA). Among other things, the processes are studied for both by-right and
    non-by-right cases. In doing so, the data are based on a collected empirical
    study in the form of qualitative expert interviews. The findings of the
    comparison provide a detailed description and illustration of the current
    building permit processes, as well as the lessons learned from both
    countries. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

    As the urgent need for efficient and sustainable energy usage becomes ever
    more apparent, interest in Smart Homes is on the rise. The SESAME-S project
    (SEmantic SmArt Metering – Services for Energy Efficient Houses) uses
    semantically linked data to actively assist end-consumers in making
    well-informed decisions and controlling their energy consumption. By
    integrating smart metering and home automation functionality, SESAME-S works
    to effectively address the potential mass market of end-consumers with an
    easily customizable solution that can be widely implemented in domestic or
    business environments, with expected savings of over 20 % from the total
    energy bill. The developed system is a basis for conceptualizing,
    demonstrating, and evaluating a variety of innovative end-consumer services
    and their user interface paradigms. In this paper, we present the SESAME-S
    system as a whole and discuss the semantically enabled services,
    demonstrating that such systems may have broad acceptance in the future. The
    data obtained through such systems will be invaluable for future global
    energy-efficiency strategies and businesses.

    Current PLM or BIM based information systems suffer from a lack of checking
    components for business rules. One reason is the misunderstanding of the
    role and nature of business rules, and how they should be treated in a
    product-centric information system. This paper intends to provide both a
    process and a related model to build such a component and enrich future
    systems. Rules and requirements process management enables the unambiguous
    formalization of implicit knowledge contained in business rules, generally
    expressed in easily understandable language, and leads to the formal
    expression of requirements. In this paper, the requirements are considered a
    consequence of the application of a business rule. A conceptual model is
    then introduced, called DALTON (DAta Linked Through Occurrences Network),
    which supports this process. In this ontology, concepts and product data,
    coming for instance from an existing product database, are represented using
    instances and occurrences, connected together with triples built from
    business rules and requirements according to previous management processes.
    An experiment involving a set of SWRL rules is conducted in the Protégé
    environment that validates the model and the process.

    Cooperation between leading industry standards supercharges the digital
    transformation of the real estate and smart building industry

    This webinar presents how the cooperation between leading industry
    standards, Brick Consortium and RealEstateCore, supercharges the digital
    transformation of the real estate and smart building industry.

    The two groups are making it easier to create rich semantic models of smart
    buildings and real estate portfolios. Currently, at-scale digital
    transformation in the real estate industry, within and across organizational
    boundaries, is challenging because of the number of competing smart building
    metadata standards.

    During the webinar led by James McHale (Memoori.com) you will learn more
    about:

    – The background and motives for the cooperation

    – A walkthrough of how Brick and RealEstateCore work together right now

    – Insight into the road map of the standards

    – An opportunity to ask questions to the experts

    With the rapid popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology,
    BIM resources such as building product libraries are growing rapidly on the
    World Wide Web. As a result, this also increases the difficulty for quickly
    finding useful BIM resources that are sufficiently close to user's specific
    needs. Keyword-based search methods have been widely used due to their ease
    of use, but their search accuracy is often not satisfactory because of the
    semantic ambiguity of terminologies in BIM-specific documents and queries.
    To address this issue, we develop a prototype semantic search engine, named
    BIMSeek, for retrieving online BIM resources. The central work consists of
    two parts as follows. Firstly, based on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
    which is a major standard for BIM, a domain ontology is constructed for
    encoding BIM-specific knowledge into the search engine. Using the ontology,
    term`inologies in BIM documents can be disambiguated and indexed. Secondly,
    by combining the ontology and local context analysis technique, an automatic
    query expansion method is presented for improving retrieval performance.
    Compared with traditional keyword-based methods and WordNet-based query
    expansion methods, the experimental results demonstrate that our method
    outperforms them. The search engine is available at
    http://cgcad.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/liuyushen/ifcqe/.

    This paper introduces an approach to automatically convert the German data
    model for documenting infrastructure inspections (ASB-ING) into a semantic
    ontology. Thus, an extensive data model is created that enables the
    representation of infrastructure and maintenance-related facts in Linked
    Data and is compatible with the German standards and guidelines. The
    national standard "ASB-ING" contains about 120 classes and 500 attributes to
    describe a bridge or tunnel and its damages. It is the basis for the
    relational database program "SIB-Bauwerke", in which most bridges in Germany
    are recorded over the last 20 years. By converting the ASB-ING model into an
    Ontology, compatibility with this extensive available data set is ensured,
    enabling a direct translation of the existing asset data into Linked Data
    models. Concurrently, it is possible to relate the classes of this national
    data model with classes of other national or international ontologies. By
    mapping the ASB-ING Ontology to ifcOWL, the formerly only tabular data can
    be linked to standardised geometry models without requiring additionally
    developed geometric representation. Interlinking the ASB-ING Ontology with
    other international and national infrastructure data models can improve
    asset information exchange of cross-border projects.

    The Building Information Model (BIM) has become a key tool to achieve
    communication during the whole building life-cycle. Open standards, such as
    the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), have contributed to expand its
    adoption, but they have limited capabilities for cross-domain information
    integration and query. To address these challenges, the Linked Building Data
    initiative promotes the use of ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in
    order to create more formal and interoperable BIMs. In this paper, we
    present a fuzzy logic-based extension of such semantic BIMs that provides
    support for imprecise knowledge representation and retrieval. We propose an
    expressive fuzzy ontology language, and describe how to use a fuzzy
    reasoning engine in a BIM context with selected examples. The resulting
    fuzzy semantic BIM enables new functionalities in the project design and
    analysis stages—namely, soft integration of cross-domain knowledge, flexible
    BIM query, and imprecise parametric modeling.

  abstract: "Abstract This paper presents an indoor navigation support system based on the Building Information Models (BIM) paradigm. Although BIM is initially defined for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction/Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry, the authors believe that it can provide added value in this context. To this end, the authors will focus on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard for the formal representation of BIM. The approach followed in this paper will be based on the ifcOWL ontology, which translates the IFC schemas into Ontology Web Language (OWL). Several modifications of this ontology have been proposed, consisting of the inclusion of new items, SWRL rules and SQWRL searches. This way of expressing the elements of a building can be used to code information that is very useful for navigation, such as the location of elements related to the actions desired by the user. It is important to note that this design is intended to be used as a complement to other well-known tools and techniques for indoor navigation. The proposed modifications have been successfully tested in a variety of simulated and real scenarios. The main limitation of the proposal is the immense amount of information contained in the ifcOWL ontology, which causes difficulties involving its processing and the time necessary to perform operations on it. Those elements that are considered important have been selected, removing those that seem secondary to navigation. This procedure will result in a significant reduction in the storage and semantic processing of the information. Thus, for a system with 1000 individuals (in the ontological sense), the processing time is about 90\_s. The authors regard this time as acceptable, since in most cases the tasks involved can be considered part of the system initialization, meaning they will only be executed once at the beginning of the process."

    BIM has had a major impact on the design of new buildings but it has so far
    had little effect on workflows in construction projects. In this paper we
    present how BIM enhanced with linked data can provide comprehensive workflow
    support with natural data ownership and governance, granular online data
    sharing, and change management based on notifications downstream and change
    requests upstream. Linked data is used to link object instances in different
    models and many of the links can be created automatically as byproduct of
    design progression using a reference modeling paradigm for BIM software.

    This paper raises the principle question whether performance based
    regulatory statements can be implemented into BIM (building information
    modeling)

    based model checking software or not.Model checking software is quite common
    among

    professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction industry
    (AEC-industry). Most focus is now

    on clash-detection for assessment of model quality. Compliance checking for
    verification of legality

    is much referred, but the numbers of regulations

    implemented are still limited. Possibilities regarding

    building approval are announced as the next step for

    utilizing the potential of BIM. This will enable designers to validate
    compliance with public building codes

    in advance of submission of application. The AEC

    industry has to take into consideration several sets

    of regulations etc.. Implementation in a BIM-based

    model checking software could benefit for the industry in terms of faster
    and more reliable checking of

    compliance with regulations.

    A smart built environment has become necessary for ensuring social
    well-being due to uncontrolled population growth and unrestrainable urban
    sprawl. In this connection, effective land administration is a significant
    element to actualize sustainable development. Yet existing building permit
    procedures fail to satisfy the need for current construction demands because
    of the insufficient transparency and inefficient procedures. Two dimensional
    (2D) based systems also remain incapable to unambiguously delineate the
    property ownership related to complex buildings. Keeping up-to-date the
    three dimensional (3D) urban models is another key for smart cities but this
    issue has become difficult owing to the rapid changes in the cities. In this
    sense, this paper first examines thoroughly the current situation in Turkey
    in terms of the building permit procedures, land administration, and 3D city
    modeling. Then, the paper detailedly proposes a reformative framework. The
    framework consists of the use of digital building models for both building
    permit processes and 3D registration of property ownership, as well as
    updating the 3D city model databases. The proposed framework is evaluated in
    terms of its applicability with a discussion of the prospective directions.

    Building information modeling (BIM) allows representation of de-tailed
    information regarding building elements while geographic information system
    (GIS) allows representation of spatial information about buildings and their
    surroundings. Overlapping these domains will combine their individual
    fea-tures and provide support to important activities such as building
    emergency re-sponse, construction site safety, construction supply chain
    management, and sus-tainable urban design. Interoperability through open
    data standards is one method of connecting software tools from BIM and GIS
    domains. However, no single open data standard available today can support
    all information from the two do-mains. As a result, many researchers have
    been working to overlap or connect different open data standards to enhance
    interoperability. An overview of these studies will help identify the
    different approaches used and determine the ap-proach with the most
    potential to enhance interoperability. This paper adopted a strong
    definition of interoperability using information technology (IT) based
    standard documents. Based on this definition, previous approaches towards
    im-proving interoperability between BIM and GIS applications through open
    data standards were studied. The result shows previous approaches have
    implemented data conversion, data integration, and linked data approaches.
    Between these methods, linked data emerged as having the most potential to
    connect open data standards and expand interoperability between BIM and GIS
    applications be-cause it allows information exchange without editing the
    original data. The paper also identifies the main challenges in implementing
    linked data technologies for interoperability and provides directions for
    future research.

    Data from building automation and control systems are becoming more and more
    important, since they are used in a growing number of (novel and
    established) analytics applications such as fault detection &amp;
    diagnostics (FDD), smart maintenance and optimization. However, the quality
    of such data is often poor due to erroneous installation, commissioning,
    data recording or meta-information. In addition, building automation
    engineering and service departments usually focus on implementing and
    maintaining basic control functionality – data acquisition, tagging quality,
    and analytics do often not take priority. Due to these data quality issues,
    a first important step in any data analytics operation is to ensure data
    integrity. One main goal of data integrity checks is to increase data
    reliability. The paper presents such checks for building automation
    applications, in particular three different types of plausibility checks for
    time series data: single signal tests, similarity tests, and reaction tests.
    Examples using data recorded from real building automation project are
    presented for each of the three check types, demonstrating the usefulness of
    these checks. Data integrity checks are set up and configured using the
    available metadata which – in our case – comes in the form of semantic
    models that are automatically generated from building automation engineering
    data. Many data integrity checks have been identified that are potentially
    of great benefit in practice – both as a stand-alone application or as first
    part in a data analytics process. The major prerequisite for successful data
    integrity checking is that the checks can be set up with minimal effort and
    executed periodically. To achieve a high degree of automation, semantic data
    is of great importance, because it is through them that the recorded time
    series are provided with context and meaning. The automatically generated
    semantic models from building automation engineering proved to be already
    rich in automation information and are sufficient for many of the checks
    investigated.

    The information delivery in BIM-based construction projects regarding
    predefined exchange requirements is crucial for the quality of information.
    Information modeling using Linked Building Data receives increasing
    attention as it may overcome current interoperability issues. Hence, this
    information needs to satisfy requirements defined in business processes in
    an Information Delivery Manual. This paper examines the compatibility of
    business process modeling and Linked Building Data. Considering recent
    research progresses, the Information Delivery Processes ontology is
    developed and evaluated in two demonstration cases for converting XML-based
    business processes to RDF-based ontology data and performing requirements
    validation for the attached data sets. These use cases show the feasibility
    of the application of the developed approach for modeling information
    deliveries for Linked Building Data.

  abstract: >-
    Within the scope of non-destructive inspections, it frequently happens that
    damages within the construction structure or at inaccessible areas are not
    detected. Thus, human experts must assume these damages by evaluating
    relevant information about the construction and its surroundings, which
    could become a time-consuming and error prone task. For this reason, a new
    approach is presented in this paper, in which a knowledge system has been
    developed utilizing Semantic Web Technologies to automatically infer new
    information about potential undetected damage areas based on past
    generalized experiences. Thereby, ontological models for defining
    information about the affected construction and the already inspected
    damages are used as data input and reasoned by applying predefined rules
    formalized in Description Logic. Furthermore, the possibility for occurrence
    of each assumed damage is determined by utilizing fuzzy set theory.

  abstract: >-
    During the inspection and assessment of existing buildings, a large portion
    of the recorded data is stored in documents or models that are not com-puter
    interpretable. Managing this data digitally is a complex process because the
    evaluation of the building components and the affecting structural damages
    in-volves a significant amount of manual tasks that can be error-prone and
    time consuming. Therefore, a knowledge-based approach has been developed,
    which utilizes web ontologies to store building and damage information in a
    semantic representation and processes them in an automated assessment via
    predefined rulesets. The concept is specified and applied for structures
    made of natural stone and is specifically tested and verified on the common
    case of a damaged façade. A newly developed software platform is presented,
    which provides functions for managing and evaluating a damage ontology as
    well as linking damage infor-mation with a geometry-based BIM model by
    utilizing an Information Container for linked Document Delivery (ICDD)
    according to ISO 21597-1 and adapting a general-purpose BIMification
    approach for retrofitting.

    Energy use in the building sector shares a great portion of world energy and
    accounts for a lot of green house gas. It is necessary to increase energy
    efficiency in the building sector to reduce energy cost and green house gas
    emissions. This paper proposes a building energy management system based on
    ontology, inference rules, and simulation. Ontology modeling has the
    advantages of information reusability, extensibility, and interoperability.
    It enables the BEMS to be easily deployed in the field. Building energy
    simulation helps the inference rules accumulated. The efficiency will be
    increased in proportional to the number of inference rules. The feasibility
    of the proposed BEMS model is shown through the pilot system. The proposed
    model is expected to greatly contribute to the energy saving and the
    reduction of green house gas emissions.

    Improving the performance of existing buildings has provided a broad market
    for the green renovation of US building stock currently estimated at 76
    billion square feet. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has had a
    remarkable impact on the building industry by enhancing productivity and
    document accuracy. The integrative nature of BIM technology renders it an
    ideal tool for implementing sustainable strategies into the renovation and
    retrofit of existing structures. The intent of this research is to determine
    what functions of BIM could be utilized to implement sustainable design
    principles in new and existing structures in Saudi Arabia by exploring the
    nature of the relationship between BIM platforms and sustainability. The
    study sought to establish a framework for sustainability in Saudi Arabia. In
    recent times, Saudi Arabia’s market gasoline prices have dropped
    dramatically, necessitating the kingdom to establish its 2030 vision. The
    2030 vision aims to make Saudi Arabia an ideal sustainable society by
    reducing its reliance on petrol, creating more sustainable buildings, and
    using renewable energy resources. Due to the lack of a national rating
    system in the kingdom, LEED will be used as a guideline to formulate a
    unique rating system suitable for Saudi Arabia and supports the kingdom’s
    2030 vision. This research aims to provide a BIM framework to achieve the
    envisioned sustainability goals and implement sustainable design principles
    in Saudi Arabia. Further, the study aims to develop a new rating system for
    Saudi Arabia that is fully integrated with BIM platforms.

    With the popularization of BIM technology and its application, project
    review and approval based on BIM has gradually became a hot topic in the
    industry. BIMchecker, an intelligent BIM model checking tool developed by
    Tsinghua University, has its own characteristics in the structural
    description of complex building codes and its knowledge based checking
    engine. Based on the innovative cooperation between Tsinghua University and
    China Academy of Building Research in Hunan BIM checking system, this paper
    introduced the method and application of the intelligent BIM model checking
    tool in the BIM platform and fire protection checking procedure. By
    constructing the SNL rule library of the fire protection code, applying the
    semantic reasoning function and the semantic and geometric calculation fuzed
    implementation of the checking tool, the BIM checking platform can make full
    use of the checking ability of the BIMchecker tool, while retaining its
    original features in data standards, process management, visualization,
    etc.. This paper provides a reference on how to realize intelligent BIM
    model checking in the building process of project review and approval based
    on BIM.

    Rule checking is important to assure the integrity, correctness and
    usability of Building Information Models (BIMs) in Architecture, Engineering
    and Construction (AEC) projects. Semantic web based rule checking of BIM
    models are widely accepted and studied recent years. This technology has
    noteworthy advantages on interoperability, extensibility and logical basics.
    However, there are still some gaps to make it practical. One challenge is
    the efficiency problem on processing large-scale BIM models. The other is
    how to effectively input checking rules which can be understood by both
    human beings and machines. In this paper, we propose a pragmatic method to
    check real-world scale BIM models. In our framework, BIM models are
    transformed into a well-defined OWL model. Rules are formalized by a
    structured natural language (SNL) designed intentionally to describe
    building regulations. The checking engine is based on SPARQL queries on OWL
    models. We propose a rule-based model extraction method and optimization
    strategies on SPARQL statements, which can effectively improve the time
    efficiency and deal with large-scale applications. A prototype has been
    implemented and applied to BIM models of a real-world building project. We
    found out non-trivial problems in a totally automatic way, which helped to
    improve the quality of BIM models and verified the usability of our method.

    This paper proposes a framework for classification of Building Information
    Model (BIM) checking concepts. Although BIM-based model checking (BMC) and
    similar terms are widely used, there is a lack of joint understanding of the
    different types of checking and the use of terms. The study uses an
    ontological approach to develop a framework with the intention to classify
    unique concepts of BMC. The following concepts for BMC were identified: A)
    Compliance checking solutions, separated into: 1) Validation checking and 2)
    Content checking, and B) Design solution checking, separated into: 3) Smart
    objects checking and 4) Design option checking. All concepts are presented
    with principles and examples, and as Linked Data with RDF-graph. The impact
    of this overview can contribute to improved understanding of BMC, improved
    understanding and clarification of expectations, and joint terms for common
    use.

    Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based model checking is maybe the best
    way to utilize BIM technology and to contribute to the development of new
    procedures in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry
    by enabling reuse of knowledge (McHill, 2012). This research seeks to
    increase the utilisation of BIM-based model checking (BMC) solutions in
    general, and automated checking of regulations in particular, thereby
    exploring and suggesting a range of theoretical and practical methods for
    transforming regulations into applicable digital rules. Regulations include
    acts and codes with related guidelines and standards.  

    The target group for use of the developed methods are developers of
    computable rule specifications – applicable for implementation in
    applications to be used by the entire construction industry. The
    specification of the computable rules will then be programmed into software
    and implemented as new processes for quality assessment of designed
    solutions or compliance checking.  

    There has been limited research attention to methods for transforming
    written building regulations on a large scale into computable rules for BMC
    that can be specified in an efficient way. This research intends to
    establish a foundation for the first stage in the development of applicable
    rules in BMC which can be adapted for use with the major part of the
    requirements in the regulations which are applicable for digitalisation.
    Reduction of complexity has been a major guiding star in both the research
    approach and the development of methods.  

    The background for this research is deeply rooted in the needs of the AEC
    industry (architects, engineers, contractors). BMC rules are today mostly
    focused on clash detection by use of simple geometry-based logic for the
    conjunction of different parts of building elements like beams and ducts.
    Free space for a turning circle is another example of a rule based on
    detection of geometrical conjunction. This type of model-checking replaces
    visual inspection and the need for information and interpretation is
    limited. Support of BMC in knowledge-based domains like compliance checking
    regulations, or compliance with specifications in contracts, is so far
    limited but is expected to be the new area in BMC. Today’s challenge is
    therefore to express the regulations in a way that enables valid
    interpretations of computable rules in BMC.

    Municipalities invest a lot of time and person-hours into manual building
    permit checks. With the increase in computational power and the use of
    Building Information Models (BIM) in the building design life cycle, several
    municipalities are investing in automating these checks using BIM and
    geo-data sets. However, few examples exist of tools effectively using
    geo-information with BIM. In order to address this gap, a project was
    developed with the municipality of Rotterdam (NL). In a previous phase, a
    tool was implemented, able to analyse the BIM data to extract the needed
    information for a few representative regulations. In order to extend and
    improve the previously developed tool, a web-based interface is now
    implemented and geo-data sets are integrated to the process allowing more
    powerful GeoBIM analysis. Three checks using both BIM and GIS data were
    implemented and tested: (i) The parcel limit check evaluates if the
    building's footprint derived from BIM falls within the parcel limit provided
    from the municipalities' parcel data sets. (ii) The height check evaluates
    the maximum building's relative height to the road's height. Finally, (iii)
    the road overhang check detects neighbouring roads to the parcel and
    evaluates the admissible overhang over that road. This paper presents these
    developments, including the type of input data that is needed for the
    checks, the tools for the three new GeoBIM checks (parcel limit check,
    height check, road overhang check) and the implementation in the web-based
    tool. © 2022 N. Hobeika et al.

    We report on a project to develop round-trip interoperability between the
    grid utility and building management systems (BMS), and between buildings
    running heterogeneous management systems, which have traditionally been
    information silos. The approach is based on the semantic integration of
    energy and building information models with a common, or system-agnostic,
    semantic layer. Standards tend to have a very narrow focus of applicability,
    so growing a system-agnostic domain model involves the integration of
    several standards (in this case FSGIM, OpenADR, IFC, SAREF, QUDT, SOSA, NIST
    Tariff, and BRICK) into a cohesive model. The resulting information layer
    provides a foundation for round-trip translation, validation, logic, and
    reasoning, and is part of a cloud-based platform that provides a messaging
    hub. The approach is currently being tested in a pilot study with 23
    buildings in the two primary California power utilities, PG&E and Southern
    California Edison.

    Digital planning methods are changing the needs of construction
    stakeholders. It should be as easy as possible to compare product data from
    different manufacturers and integrate them into the planning model without
    detours. Web technologies not only offer great potential to enhance existing
    ways of working, but also open up new business models for product
    manufacturers in the service and IOT domains. However, manufacturers have a
    legitimate interest to retain control over the disclosure of their product
    data. Therefore, it is often only available offline and on demand. Of
    technical interest are therefore solutions, in which a large part of the
    data autonomy and access control remains on the side of the manufacturer,
    but the project planner is allowed to search the product data of all
    manufacturers like an interconnected system. Frequently, such a
    searchability is ensured by a uniform data schema and storage of the data in
    a central storage location, a so-called data warehouse. Nonetheless, this
    stands in contrast to the natural interest of the manufacturer for data
    sovereignty. This paper focuses on systems that can replace centralized data
    storage with distributed data management on manufacturer-owned servers,
    without losing accessibility for planners. Manufacturers should have as much
    freedom of implementation as possible when establishing the security
    concept, modeling their data and integrating the proposed approach into
    their operating procedure.

  abstract: >-
    Model checking is an important task in the BIM collaboration process to
    prevent expensive planning errors. The submodels of the individual
    disciplines are transferred into a coordination model. Part of the transfer
    is a conversion into an exchange format. The exchange format allows the
    import into the model checking application. In the model checking
    application routines are performed to check the model against collisions and
    building regulation violations. During the transfer into the exchange
    format, information may get lost, especially with parameters that are not
    yet part of the exchange format supported by the authoring software. In
    recent years, ontologies have been investigated as a feasible approach to
    combine the submodels, since they model data in a flexible manner. Hence in
    the conversion process to an application-specific ontology, the data
    structure of the submodels can widely persist, which could lead to smaller
    information loss in comparison to converting the data into a standardized
    exchange format. The evaluation of the geometric properties of the building
    is indispensable for detecting and analyzing collisions. The basis for the
    connection of the different sub models could be the BOT (Building Topology
    Ontology), which defines the topological structure of a building and can be
    used to represent further building information by linking it with other
    ontologies. The relevant geometric relationships for the collision model
    checks have to be derived with a geometry kernel. For the research in this
    paper pythonOCC, a wrapper for the geometry kernel Open CASCADE is used with
    the Semantic Web's own query language SPARQL, queries can be formulated to
    analyze the collision relationships in combination with other semantic
    information. These queries can be used to verify model correctness. By
    connecting the information from different domains, more sophisticated tests
    are possible than in an exchange format dependent model checking
    application. The goal is to integrate the developed functionalities into a
    project platform. This platform is based on an extensive project description
    in an ontology-based data model and is connected to different authoring
    tools for the exchange of information.

    Realizing complete digital intake and processing of building permit
    applications has been a long time challenge for many governments. Especially
    the processing of digital drawings and plans constitutes a major obstacle.
    In 2004 legal barriers to communicate digitally between government and
    applicants have disappeared in the Netherlands. A group of local governments
    used the momentum to study the feasibility of a large scale introduction of
    the intake of digital building permit applications by using a shared
    services concept. The feasibility study contained technical, economical,
    juridical and demand site feasibility aspects. This paper reports especially
    on the demand site feasibility. The paper is mend to present a case study
    about the readiness of both applicants and local governments in the
    Netherlands to deal with building permit applications in a digital way.

    Building construction industry has significant impact on sustainability. The
    construction, operation and maintenance of buildings account for
    approximately 50% of global energy usage and anthropogenic greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions. In recent years, the embodied energy and carbon are
    identified increasingly important in terms of sustainability throughout
    building life cycle. Incorporation of sustainable development in building
    structural design becomes undoubtedly crucial. The effective building design
    requires smart and holistic tools that can process multi-objective and
    inter-connected domain knowledge to provide genuine sustainable buildings. 

    With the advancement of information and communication technologies, various
    methods and techniques have been applied to accomplish the multiple
    objectives of sustainable development in building design. One of the most
    successful approaches is building information modelling (BIM), which
    requires further enhancement of interoperability. The emergence of Semantic
    Web technology provides more opportunity to improve the information
    modelling, knowledge management and system integration. 

    The research presented in this thesis investigates how ontology and Semantic
    Web rules can be used in a knowledge-based holistic system, in order to
    integrate information about structural design and sustainability, and
    facilitate decision-making in design process by recommending appropriate
    solutions for different use cases. A research prototype namely OntoSCS
    incorporating OWL ontology and SWRL rules has been developed and tested in
    typical structural design cases. The holistic approach considers five
    inter-connected dimensions of sustainability, including structural
    feasibility, embodied energy and carbon, cost, durability and safety. In
    addition, the selection of structural material supplier and criteria in
    sustainability assessment are taken into account as well. This research
    concludes that the Semantic Web technology can be applied to structural
    design at early stage to provide multi-criteria optimised solution. The
    methodology and framework employed in this study can be further adapted as a
    generic multi-criteria and holistic decision support system for other
    domains in construction sector.

    Abstract A pronounced gap often exists between expected and actual building
    performance. The multi-faceted and cross lifecycle causes of this
    performance gap are found in design assumptions, construction issues and
    commissioning and operational compromises. Some important factors are firmly
    rooted in the lack of interoperability around building information. New
    solutions to the interoperability challenge offer the potential to leverage
    and reuse available heterogeneous data in a manner that can significantly
    assist building performance assessment. Linked data provides an open,
    modular and extensible solution for the challenge. However, in the buildings
    domain, the integration of rule-based performance metrics and contextual
    information has yet to be formally established. This paper describes an
    approach to the provision of in-depth building performance assessment
    through the integration of OpenMath and linked data. An ontology describing
    performance metrics in RDF is presented, together with an automated metric
    evaluation solution using multi-silo queries and computer algebra systems,
    providing a flexible, automated and extensible mechanism for the assessment
    of building performance. Building managers and engineers can simultaneously
    analyse time-series building performance at a range of levels, without
    burdensome manual intervention such as is the case with traditional
    solutions. A test implementation on a large university building highlights
    the potential of this solution.

    Buildings tend to not operate as intended, and a pronounced gap often exists
    between measured and predicted environmental and energy performance.
    Although the causes of this ‘performance gap’ are multi-faceted, issues
    surrounding data integration are key contributory factors. The distributed
    nature of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry
    presents many challenges to the effective capture, integration and
    assessment of building performance data. Not all building data can be
    described semantically, nor is it feasible to create adapters between many
    different software tools. Similarly, not all building contextual data can
    easily be captured in a single product-centric model. This paper presents a
    new solution to the problem based upon a hybrid architecture that links data
    which is retained in its original format. The architecture links existing
    and efficient relational databases storing time-series data and
    semantically-described building contextual data. The main contribution of
    this work is an original RDF syntax structure and ontology to represent
    existing database schema information, and a new mechanism that automatically
    prepares data streams for processing by rule-based performance definitions.
    Two test cases evaluate the concept by 1) applying the hybrid architecture
    to building performance data from an actual building, and 2) evaluating the
    efficiency of the architecture against a purely RDF-based solution that also
    stores all of the time-series data in RDF for a virtual building. The hybrid
    architecture also avoids the duplication of time-series data and overcomes
    some of the differences found in database schemas and database platforms.

    As an important kind of infrastructure, a tunnel’s life is estimated to be
    100 years or more. During its service life, effective maintenance strategy
    plays an essential role to keep its availability and safety. Maintenance
    work involves a set of participants, activities and resources, bringing
    difficulties to implement effective maintenance. This paper proposes an
    e-maintenance framework combining BIM, IFC and semantic web technologies to
    help maintenance managers and maintenance personnel to get information they
    need timely and accurately, making effective maintenance decisions. A cost
    analysis case is provided in this paper to illustrate the implementation
    mechanism and the validation of this method.

    In the past, knowledge in the fields of Architecture, Engineering and
    Construction (AEC) industries mainly come from experiences and are
    documented in hard copies or specific electronic databases. In order to make
    use of this knowledge, a lot of studies have focused on retrieving and
    storing this knowledge in a systematic and accessible way. The Building
    Information Modeling (BIM) technology proves to be a valuable media in
    extracting data because it provides physical and functional digital models
    for all the facilities within the life-cycle of the project. Therefore, the
    combination of the knowledge science with BIM shows great potential in
    constructing the knowledge map in the field of the AEC industry. Based on
    literature reviews, this article summarizes the latest achievements in the
    fields of knowledge science and BIM, in the aspects of (1) knowledge
    description, (2) knowledge discovery, (3) knowledge storage and management,
    (4) knowledge inference and (5) knowledge application, to show the
    state-of-arts and suggests the future directions in the application of
    knowledge science and BIM technology in the fields of AEC industries. The
    review indicates that BIM is capable of providing information for knowledge
    extraction and discovery, by adopting semantic network, knowledge graph and
    some other related methods. It also illustrates that the knowledge is
    helpful in the design, construction, operation and maintenance periods of
    the AEC industry, but now it is only at the beginning stage.

    As an important kind of infrastructure, a tunnel's life is estimated to be
    100 years or more. During its service life, an effective maintenance
    strategy plays an essential role in keeping its availability and safety.
    Maintenance work involves a set of participants, activities, and resources,
    and in this case, tunnel‐related data are distributed to heterogeneous
    information management systems in varying formats, bringing difficulties to
    implement effective maintenance. This paper proposes an E‐maintenance
    Framework for Public Infrastructure (EFPI), combining Building Information
    Modeling (BIM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), and Semantic Web
    technologies to help integrate heterogeneous data and expert knowledge,
    enable information sharing through the whole life cycle, and support
    maintenance managers to make effective maintenance decisions. A cost
    estimation case is provided in this paper to illustrate the implementation
    mechanism and validate the proposed approach.

    The advancing digitalization in the building industry highlights weak points
    in the digital

    infrastructure. Due to heterogeneous software landscapes, cross-application
    data exchange, in

    particular, is a frequently criticized process for which no satisfying
    solution exists, so far. To

    overcome interoperability difficulties, open and application-independent
    data formats are necessary

    and the communication between software applications needs to be
    standardized. For the first aspect,

    the current research project SCOPE investigates the extent to which Semantic
    Web can be used as

    an alternative to conventional approaches. The ontologies developed and
    applied in the research

    project focus on geometry descriptions, the linking of geometric and
    non-geometric contents and

    the abstract description of building products. The second, overarching
    aspect is addressed by

    defining an underlying architecture. Hence, a microservice structure is
    proposed that allows the data

    to be extended and enriched with the help of the aforementioned ontologies.

    cross-application data exchange is a frequently criticized process in
    particular, for which no satisfying solution exists so far. Open and

    Semantic Web Technologies. This article proposes an approach that enriches a
    graph with relevant information for structural design and provides the
    enhanced description as a calculation basis for structural analysis
    software. A novel ontology, the TDY-Ontology, is designed to connect
    geometry descriptions with structural-specific semantic information, like
    the standard of the analysis to be executed, bearing arrangements, bedding
    of floor slabs or the definition of joints and loads.

    The upsurge of design complexity through the application of Building
    Information Modelling (BIM) leads to various development of automation in
    designing and construction processes including automation in the compliance
    checking process. The compliance of building designs to fire safety
    regulations holds an utmost importance to ensure adequate fire safety level
    in the building. The automation in compliance checking process could save
    significant time and cost as well as avoid inaccuracies. Since regulations
    are commonly written in human linguistic format, the semantics of the
    regulations need to be captured and extracted to translate them into
    computer interpretable rules. This paper demonstrates the process in
    capturing the semantics of fire safety regulations in Selangor Uniform
    Building By-Laws 1984 through the adoption of knowledge formalisation
    method. A framework was developed to provide a comprehensive guideline in
    capturing the semantics for the classification of fire safety regulations.
    The framework affirms the reliability of executing this method for other
    building regulations. This paper is an ongoing research in developing an
    automated BIM-based fire regulations compliance checking system in Malaysia,
    whereby the results attained from this paper will be used to extract the
    semantics of the regulations to create computer interpretable rules.

  abstract: >-
    The checking process of the building design with building regulations or
    codes is a time-consuming and error prone process. The automation of code
    compliance checking process has been explored since 1960s and becoming more
    vigorous with the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM). A
    neutral format, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which is developed under
    BIM platform had led to better collaboration and information exchange
    throughout BIM software and development of the checking system. Generally,
    the structure of an automated system consists of rule interpretation stage,
    building model preparation stage, rule execution stage and rule reporting
    stage. Rule interpretation stage is the most vital and complex stage. In
    interpreting the rules, various techniques have been investigated and
    applied to employ comprehensive and accurate checking process on the
    building designs which are mainly in IFC format. The most common techniques
    used are by utilizing existing software such as Solibri Model Checker,
    establishing a plug-in application, adopting object-based approach, logical
    approach and ontological approach. This paper provides a highlight and
    review on previous studies which successfully employed the appropriate
    techniques in interpreting the rules for checking purposes. This will
    subsequently assist future research on this area and create more astounding
    code compliance checking system.

    Sponsored by the Computing and Information Technology Division of ASCE The
    use of ontology as a shared conceptualization has the potential to be a
    solution to represent and manage information. However, problems with
    reconciliation of the concepts into an ontology standard and problems with
    representation of expressiveness and reasoning hinder significantly the
    construction of well-founded and tractable ontologies for use in dynamic,
    complex, real-world contexts. Ontology in the AEC Industry contains 10
    chapters, contributed by international researchers, that provide an overview
    of recent advances in ontology research in the architectural, engineering,
    and construction (AEC) domain with a focus on enabling information exchange,
    sharing, and integration and on facilitating users. understanding of the
    semantics of information in any project activity involving information
    management.  Topics include: management of semantically expressive
    information; foundational-driven practical ontologies; relating context to
    ontology; evaluation methods and metrics of AEC domain ontologies; and
    issues of validation and collaboration.  Researchers and students in civil
    engineering, construction management, and computer science will find this
    publication a valuable resource.

  abstract: >-
    The IFC data model has several hundred entities and thousands of attributes,
    relationships, quantity and property sets that can represent various aspects
    of a construction project. A one-to-one mapping between a BIM software
    tool's native data format and the IFC data exchange standard is not
    possible. This complexity makes it difficult for the translator modules in a
    BIM software tool to accurately map the IFC elements, causing
    interoperability problems while exchanging BIM data using IFC. Also, there
    are mistakes made by the software developers in implementing the mapping to
    and from IFC data exchange standard, which adds to the issue. A proposed
    approach to tackle the interoperability problem is to adopt a 'divide and
    conquer' method by classifying IFC entities as per their relative importance
    for a discipline and to rectify the interoperability issues of the most
    important entities first. This paper proposes a framework to classify the
    IFC entities as per their relative importance with respect to various
    disciplines and introduce an index called RI (Relative Importance). This
    paper also suggests the application of the proposed framework in the
    interoperability measurement (conformance testing) implementation for BIM
    software tools, and in presenting the results of conformance tests.

    This research aims to describe an implementation
    approach for a translator of KBimCode as a part of a BIM-enabled
    automated design rule checking system. KBimCode is an explicit and
    computer-readable form written in a scripting language to represent
    Korea Building Act sentences. KBimCode separates the rule-making
    process that conventionally dependent on rule-checking software.
    Based on the approach, KBimCode implemented with its own logic rule
    components and has been managed with the database. On the other hand,
    there are several rule-checking software executed with their own rule set.
    Translating natural language rules into the rule set of each software and
    translating a rule of specific software into others require a lot of manual
    effort. The manual translation also hinders interoperability between
    rule checking software. We address the problem with developing the
    KBimCode translator for each rule checking software. In this research,
    we focused on translating KBimCode into an executable code of specific
    rule checking software, named KBimAssess. KBimCode translator
    will integrate the rule-making and rule-checking process, which means
    various stakeholders, even who are not familiar with programming,
    can easily conduct BIM-enabled rule checking by utilizing KBimCode.
    Furthermore, the implementation of KBimCode translator is expected
    to contribute to the enhancement of interoperability between various
    rule-checking applications.

    retrieve and formalize rules from implicit knowledge, past construction
    projects can be analyzed. In this paper, we present an image analysis
    pipeline to retrieve information on past construction sites from airborne
    images. We fuse machine learning based image analysis with georeferencing
    and openly available geospatial data to retrieve a detailed description with
    true dimensions of the construction site at hand.

    This presentation describes the use of linked data approaches to permit
    queries across large, diverse information sources to allow reasoning about
    complex questions at multiple geographic scales. The developed methodology
    leverages a central spine model that provides a common hierarchical context;
    various heterogeneous external information sources can be associated with
    these contexts, creating a homogeneous data network that can be queried
    using federated SPARQL queries. These distributed sources are, in
    themselves, registered in a central catalogue in order to facilitate data
    discovery; the actual data, however, remains under the control of their
    source organisations. In this way a large, extensible, interconnected
    network of distributed data describing a built environment can be
    constructed; this network can be queried centrally to provide customised
    views of subsets of the data.

  abstract: >-
    The construction industry is a collaborative environment with the
    in-volvement of multiple disciplines and activities throughout the Building
    Lifecy-cle Stages. The collaboration requires the iterative and coordinated
    exchange of information for significant improvement of the building design,
    construction and management. The successful representation of these
    information refine-ments enables the identification of the required level of
    detail (LOD) for data sharing parameters between the multiple disciplines.
    Since the last decade, LOD is a promising approach for efficient
    representation of semantically rich BIM data in different levels. Despite
    the improvement, there is a lack of effi-cient implementation in building
    lifecycle functionalities, because of their fun-damental heterogeneity,
    versatility and adaptability. The proposed approach en-ables the
    representation of LOD-sensitive BIM data through the formal defini-tion of
    ontologies. The paper validates this approach based on the concept of
    competency questions and their respective SPARQL queries. With the
    demon-stration and validation, the paper provides the conceptual proof for
    the practical application of the developed approach. The proposed solution
    can also be easily adaptable and applicable to the present BIM process since
    the representation of BIM data in different ontologies (BOT, ifcOWL, etc.)
    are within reach.

    Energy management systems in buildings and their district today use
    automation systems and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for smart
    energy management, but they fail to achieve the desired results due to the
    lack of holistic and optimised decision-making. A reason for this is the
    silo-oriented approach to the decision-making failing to consider
    cross-domain data. Ontologies, as a new way of processing domain knowledge,
    have been increasingly applied to different domains using formal and
    explicit knowledge representation to conduct smart decision-making. In this
    PhD research, Real-time Multiscale Smart Energy Management and Optimisation
    (REMO) ontology was developed, as a cross-domain knowledge-base, which
    consequently can be used to support holistic real-time energy management in
    districts considering both demand and supply side optimisation. The ontology
    here, is also presented as the core of a proposed framework which
    facilitates the running of AI solutions and automation systems, aiming to
    minimise energy use, emissions, and costs, while maintaining comfort for
    users. The state of the art AI solutions for prediction and optimisation
    were concluded through authors involvement in European Union research
    projects. The AI techniques were independently validated through action
    research and achieved about 30 - 40 % reduction in energy demand of the
    buildings, and 36% reduction in carbon emissions through optimisation of the
    generation mix in the district. 

    The research here also concludes a smart way to capture the generic
    knowledge behind AI models in ontologies through rule axiom features, which
    also meant this knowledge can be used to replicate these AI models in future
    sites. Both semantic and syntactic validation were performed on the ontology
    before demonstrating how the ontology supports the various use cases of the
    framework for holistic energy management. Further development of the
    framework is recommended for the future which is needed for it to facilitate
    real-time energy management and optimisation in buildings and their
    district.

    Energy efficient building design and construction calls for extensive
    collaboration between different subfields of the Architecture, Engineering
    and Construction (AEC) community. Performing building design and
    construction engineering raises challenges on data integration and software
    interoperability. Using Building Information Modeling (BIM) data hub to host
    and integrate building models is a promising solution to address those
    challenges, which can ease building design information management. However,
    the partial model query mechanism of current BIM data hub collaboration
    model has several limitations, which prevents designers and engineers to
    take advantage of BIM. To address this problem, we propose a general and
    effective approach to generate query code based on a Model View Definition
    (MVD). This approach is demonstrated through a software prototype called
    QueryGenerator. By demonstrating a case study using multi-zone air flow
    analysis, we show how our approach and tool can help domain experts to use
    BIM to drive building design with less labour and lower overhead cost.

    Green building evaluation is an effective measure to reflect the
    sustainability performance of buildings and is beneficial to improve the
    deteriorating environment. However, most evaluation tasks are conducted in a
    manual way nowadays, which is time-consuming, laborious, and error-prone.
    Thus, a new approach taking advantage of building information model (BIM)
    and ontology is proposed in this paper to facilitate the process of green
    building evaluation. Information-rich BIM serves as the provider of
    multidisciplinary data required for green building evaluation while green
    building evaluation ontology (GBEOntology) is used for representing
    fragmented information included in evaluation standards. The reasoning
    process is realized in a Jess rule engine combining semantic web rule
    language (SWRL) rules and ontology web language (OWL) ontology. The proposed
    approach can save time and realize the reuse of green building evaluation
    standard knowledge. An implemented test case validates the effectiveness of
    the proposed approach by looking at the example of Evaluation Standard for
    Green Building (GB/T50378-2014) of China.

    The current design of infrastructure facilities is mainly driven by the
    application of guidelines, codes and international standards. The complex
    interpretation and geometric representation of those rules impedes the
    dynamic search for alternative solutions. Parallel to this, in recent years
    there has been an increasing tendency toward the adoption of 3D modeling
    solutions. Of particular benefit in the design of infrastructure facilities
    is the use of parametric modeling systems since they allow the definition of
    flexible models that can easily be adapted to satisfy changes in the
    boundary conditions. By defining dependencies and constraints, engineers are
    able to capture the underlying engineering knowledge in the parametric
    model. However, the design knowledge that can be defined by those
    instruments is limited to a reduced number of constraints and simple
    algebraic relations among parameters that are clearly insufficient to
    describe the complexity of engineering rules. To close this technological
    gap, this paper presents a novel knowledge-based engineering (KBE) approach
    that captures the design knowledge engineers apply in the interpretation and
    generation of infrastructure models based on rules specific for
    infrastructure facilities. To achieve this, distinct knowledge units named
    logic models capture the generation knowledge needed to convert the abstract
    information engineers must deal with into a corresponding parametric
    geometry model. In addition, this paper presents a methodology to integrate
    logic models with parametric design systems. To this end, logic models are
    introduced as a new set of domain-specific features responsible for the
    generation and management of the geometry, connecting the results with other
    part of the model by advanced procedural geometry dependencies. Finally, the
    proposed methodology is verified in a real case study for a suburban railway
    tunnel that is in the planning stage in the city of Munich, Germany. The
    paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the proposed approach and an
    outlook on future developments.

    Simulations enable detailed studies about the behavior of the building for
    optimizing the energy-efficiency. While this is an absolute advantage there
    are also problems regarding the daily work of experts because the
    simulations costs much time and before simulations can be done the
    configuration can be very huge and the pre-processing erroneous. To overcome
    these problems an eeBIM-ontology-based (Energy Enhanced BIM) framework is
    proposed applying inference rules to pre-check the input data and to
    pre-analyse the energy performance, before the simulation phase will start.
    The ontology specification provides concepts and relations to describe the
    building, the external data like the climate data as well as the linking
    between the BIM-concepts and the external data. Furthermore, constraints and
    calculation methods are transferred as far as possible into logical rules.
    The surrounding ontology platform enables the integration of the input data
    and manages the execution of the calculation methods. It also defines
    external connection points for calculation methods, which cannot appropriate
    represented in rules.

    Checking conformance of construction management practices to practice
    specifications is typically performed manually by experts in the Engineering
    and Construction (E&C) sector. Though conformance checking is known to
    increase performance of a project, this process takes considerable time as
    several professionals have to go through thousands of pages of documents,
    complex workflows, and personal interviews. This paper aims to evaluate AI
    tools including Text mining, process mining, and image data mining for their
    utility in assisting conformance checking in construction management.
    Automated conformance checking may not only reduce manual and repetitive
    work by experts but also reduce human errors. Examples are demonstrated for
    initial validation.

    Abstract Since the early 2000s, building information modeling (BIM) has been
    used through the entire project life cycle to facilitate effective project
    collaboration and integration of data to support project activities. Despite
    the successful applications of BIM in the design and construction stages,
    the use of BIM for preconstruction planning has not gained wide acceptance
    as in other project phases. The integration of BIM and geospatial analyses
    can offer substantial benefits to manage the planning process during the
    design and preconstruction stages. However, this integration suffers from a
    lack of interoperability across the geospatial and BIM domains. Semantic web
    technology is used in this study to convey meaning, which is interpretable
    by both construction project participants as well as BIM and geographic
    information systems (GIS) applications processing the transferred data. To
    achieve this, we first translate building's elements and GIS data into a
    semantic web data format. Then we use a set of standardized ontologies for
    construction operations to integrate and query the heterogeneous spatial and
    temporal data. Finally, we use a query language to access and acquire the
    data in semantic web format. Through two scenario examples, the potential
    usefulness of the proposed methodology is validated.

    The architecture, engineering, and construction industry involves multiple
    disciplines and activities throughout the building life cycle stages (BLS).
    To enable collaboration amongst these disciplines iterative and coordinated
    exchange of information is required. This improves the design process over
    multiple BLS. Since the last decade, BIM is a well-known approach to achieve
    collaboration through semantic representation and exchange of domain data.
    Despite the improvement, there is a lack of efficient implementation and
    management of building life cycle functionalities in existing BIM solutions,
    because of their fundamental heterogeneity, complexity, and adaptability.
    This research focuses on these issues and addresses a clear perception
    through analysis of BLS from various standards and norms. The paper
    concentrates on the demonstration of efficient representation of various BLS
    through the ontological approach and their effective involvement in BIM data
    management. With the validation and evaluation through SPARQL queries, this
    paper presents an ontological framework for building life cycle data
    management.

    The World Wide Web has provided a vast distributed information space that is
    primarily designed for human consumption. The enmeshment of the Web and
    various business processes has made it imperative to define business
    information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and
    automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception;
    construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information
    sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information,
    it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer
    applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently,
    the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is
    the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) data model. Several researchers have
    investigated the limitations of IFCs data model for interoperability among
    heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an
    on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information
    modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain
    applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared
    building ontology that models building domain element types and element
    relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled
    using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element
    properties to the shared building ontology. SWRL rules are used for mapping
    element properties from one domain to another. An example demonstrates how
    the developed approach can facilitate project information sharing between
    design and estimating domains.

    Easy and solid information exchange constitutes an important part in
    BIM-based projects. To conduct reliable simulations and optimizations,
    information about products, such as luminaries, windows, doors, etc., need
    to be provided by the manufacturing industries to the building designers at
    the early design stage. Several studies and ongoing researches presented the
    Semantic Web (SW) and Linked Data (LD) technologies as an interoperable and
    flexible approach for providing product information from the manufacturers
    during the design and construction stage as well as gathering consumers data
    to the manufacturers during the operation stage. A systematic literature
    review has been conducted to investigate benefits and limitations of using
    the SW and LD technologies for developing product data templates for
    information exchanges between the building and product manufacturing
    industries in comparison with the conventional approach of information
    ex-changes using the openBIM standards. Results show that SW and LD could
    apport considerable benefits to the information exchange in the building
    sector. Moreover, SW and LD technologies enable the sharing of products’
    information from manufacturers to designers who can search product
    information, compare different products and take informed design decisions
    during the very beginning of the design process.

    Despite the advancements in digital technologies, the current building
    design examination practice is 2D and paper-based, and a large number of 2D
    plans and drawings need to be collated and interpreted to examine if the
    proposed designs comply with building regulations. Subsequently, it is prone
    to human errors that make sustainable and consistent design difficult.
    Although Building Information Modelling (BIM) is recognised as a means to
    transform the current practice into a more sustainable and productive
    practice, BIM has rarely been adopted in building design examination. This
    research aims to identify the reasons for the low uptake of BIM and to
    examine the feasibility of BIM for building design examination through a
    focus group interview and workshop. A lack of proper BIM training is
    identified as the most critical barrier to adopting BIM. Building design
    examiners indicate that BIM adoption requires consistent efforts with
    empirical errors, since the existing work processes are not flexible enough
    to embrace BIM instantly without proper BIM training. An average of three
    days can be saved by using BIM for a building regulations check. This
    research revealed that BIM is feasible for building regulation checking, and
    the low uptake is mainly caused by a lack of awareness of the BIM
    capabilities.

    With the popularization of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology,
    increasing numbers of countries are attempting to introduce BIM into their
    national building permitting processes. There are also many BIM-related
    research initiatives worldwide. Likewise, the Korean government has joined
    this trend by improving its existing e-Submission system, SEUMTER, to
    provide for BIM-based e-submission and automated code compliance checking.
    Further, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport in Korea has
    funded the Korea BIM (KBIM) building e-Submission system project. The
    Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model is an openBIM approach that has
    been designated as an international standard through the International
    Organization for Standardization. It is not dependent on specific design
    tools and is suitable for public works applications. Hence, this study
    performed a comprehensive analysis of and developed a framework for a
    prototypical system for an e-Submission process based on the IFC data model.
    Four main modules were developed to perform code checking, submission,
    pre-checking, and automated rule-making. A real-world project was used to
    verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. This
    study could increase the adoption of BIMbased building e-Submission systems
    by sharing effective and successful processes.

    Abstract The management of information throughout a building's lifecycle is
    becoming increasingly important, and building information modeling (BIM) is
    often used to ensure the interoperability of data. However, BIM-based
    facility information from the construction phase is difficult to access and
    use during the operation and maintenance phase. This occurs because the BIM
    information is not utilized well in facility management (FM). In this
    research, we propose an approach to effectively manage BIM-based FM
    information by linking the BIM-based building elements and FM work
    information in an FM system database. We present a Semantic Web-based FM
    information system that semantically links BIM data to relevant historical
    work records. The proposed ontology was evaluated using a sample dataset of
    the architectural maintenance work records of an office building. Using the
    proposed approach, facility managers will be able to increase their
    efficiency in searching related work records that consider shared BIM
    objects by enhancing the interoperability and accessibility of FM data via
    the Semantic Web.

    This paper aims to define the relational logic of in-between code articles
    as well as within atomic sentences in Korean Building Code, as an
    intermediate research and development process for the automated building
    permit system of Korea. The approach depicted in this paper enables the
    software developers to figure out the logical relations in order to compose
    KBimCode and its databases. KBimCode is a computer-readable form of Korean
    Building Code sentences based on a logic rule-based mechanism. Two types of
    relational logic definition are described in this paper. First type is a
    logic definition of relation between code sentences. Due to the complexity
    of Korean Building code structure that consists of decree, regulation or
    ordinance, an intensive analysis of sentence relations has been performed.
    Code sentences have a relation based on delegation or reference each other.
    Another type is a relational logic definition in a code sentence based on
    translated atomic sentence(TAS) which is an explicit form of atomic
    sentence(AS). The analysis has been performed because the natural language
    has intrinsic ambiguity which hinders interpreting embedded meaning of
    Building Code. Thus, both analyses have been conducted for capturing
    accurate meaning of building permit-related requirements as a part of the
    logic rule-based mechanism.

    The Building Information Modeling (BIM) and its applications enable an
    automatic building permit process based on 3D building models and their
    associated information. A crucial part of the building permit process is the
    interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building
    regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other
    countries and their projects have developed a certain type of
    rule-translation methods, KBimCode, part of the KBim application series, has
    been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an
    automatic, BIM-based building permit system on top of the current
    e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process
    usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of
    implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer
    understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric
    input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for
    developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into
    computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is
    the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations
    using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule
    reviewers. This paper describes a KBimCode visual language that is
    easy-to-write and intuitive because it uses visual symbols instead of
    textual coding.HighlightsKBVL is an approach to computer-readable building
    code in visual form.KBVL supports easy-to-make rules for complicated
    building design rules.This paper demonstrates KBVL using KBimCode for Korean
    Building permit requirements.

    Fire safety regulations impose very strict requirements on building design,
    especially for buildings built with combustible materials. It is believed
    that it is possible to improve the management of these regulations with a
    better integration of fire protection aspects in the building information
    modeling (BIM) approach. A new BIM-based domain is emerging, the automated
    code checking, with its growing number of dedicated approaches. However,
    only very few of these works have been dedicated to managing the compliance
    to fire safety regulations in timber buildings. In this paper, the
    applicability to fire safety in the Canadian context is studied by
    constituting and executing a complete method from the regulations text
    through code-checking construction to result analysis. A design science
    approach is used to propose a code-checking method with a detailed analysis
    of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) in order to obtain the
    required information. The method starts by retrieving information from the
    regulation text, leading to a compliance check of an architectural building
    model. Then, the method is tested on a set of fire safety regulations and
    validated on a building model from a real project. The selected fire safety
    rules set a solid basis for further development of checking rules for the
    field of fire safety. This study shows that the main challenges for rule
    checking are the modeling standards and the elements’ required levels of
    detail. The implementation of the method was successful for geometrical as
    well as non-geometrical requirements, although further work is needed for
    more advanced geometrical studies, such as sprinkler or fire dampers
    positioning.

    Complexity of algorithms and policies in energy systems has increased
    interactions among heterogeneous systems and information sources. Demand
    Response (DR) is a representative example where electrical grids and
    buildings communicate with each other to manage overall electricity demands.
    There are various industry standards that model the information and the
    interactions between grids and buildings. However, each building has all the
    burden of converting information from different models to its information
    model prior to using it. We envision a system-agnostic information model for
    these interactions that can reduce information conversion to/from buildings
    and invigorate the interaction. We propose an integration of ontologies and
    standards to express DR interactions and open the possibility of connecting
    other information models. We also suggest an information mediator system
    that interprets and delivers messages among grids and buildings and can
    mediate energy usage among buildings based on the system-agnostic model.

    The recent advances in the automation of metadata normalization and the
    invention of a unified schema --- Brick --- alleviate the metadata
    normalization challenge for deploying portable applications across
    buildings. Yet, the lack of compatibility between existing metadata
    normalization methods precludes the possibility of comparing and combining
    them. While generic machine learning (ML) frameworks, such as MLJAR and
    OpenML, provide versatile interfaces for standard ML problems, they cannot
    easily accommodate the metadata normalization tasks for buildings due to the
    heterogeneity in the inference scope, type of data required as input,
    evaluation metric, and the building-specific human-in-the-loop learning
    procedure. We propose Plaster, an open and modular framework that
    incorporates existing advances in building metadata normalization. It
    provides unified programming interfaces for various types of learning
    methods for metadata normalization and defines standardized data models for
    building metadata and timeseries data. Thus, it enables the integration of
    different methods via a workflow, benchmarking of different methods via
    unified interfaces, and rapid prototyping of new algorithms. With Plaster,
    we 1) show three examples of the workflow integration, delivering better
    performance than individual algorithms, 2) benchmark/analyze five algorithms
    over five common buildings, and 3) exemplify the process of developing a new
    algorithm involving time series features. We believe Plaster will facilitate
    the development of new algorithms and expedite the adoption of standard
    metadata schema such as Brick, in order to enable seamless smart building
    applications in the future.

    The paper is a follow-up of a previous investigation and effort to develop
    the ontology of the smart city (Komninos, N., Bratsas, C., Kakderi, C., and
    Tsarchopoulos, P. "Smart city ontologies: Improving the effectiveness of
    smart city applications". Journal of Smart Cities, vol. 1(1), 1-17.
    https://www.komninos.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2015-Smart-City-Ontologies-Published.pdf).
    Since the publication of this article in 2015, research and literature on
    smart cities have evolved significantly, as have the technologies for
    digital spaces and applications that support city functions. These
    developments are reflected in the present form of the smart city ontology
    2.0 we propose. It depicts the building blocks of the smart city ontology
    (technologies, structure, function, planning), and the object properties and
    data properties that connect structural blocks and classes. The aim of the
    SCO 2.0 is to provide a better understanding and description of the
    smart/intelligent city landscape; identify the main components and
    processes, the terms used to describe them, their definition and meaning;
    clarify key processes related to the integration of the different dimensions
    of the smart city, mainly the physical, social, and digital dimensions. The
    paper is accompanied by an owl file, developing the ontology through the

    Autonomous mobile robots are starting to be deployed in complex built
    environments where they need to navigate to complete the given tasks. In
    order to navigate, autonomous mobile robots often rely on environmental
    maps. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to automatically create
    topological and metric environmental maps from BIM data exported to a graph
    database. We define queries on the exported graph data-base which retrieve
    the data needed to create the maps automatically. We validate our approach
    by applying standard path planning algorithms such as A* on the generated
    maps showing that they are suitable for computing optimal paths. We regard
    this work as a first step to connect linked data methods to robotics
    algorithms and use-cases. The results show the feasibility and potential of
    exploiting the semantic richness of the data available from BIM.

    uilding Information Modeling (BIM) does not change the purpose for
    performing a task related to delivering a facility – only the means by which
    the purpose is achieved. Currently, no common language exists for the
    purposes of implementing BIM. This lack of a common language makes it
    challenging to precisely communicate with others the purposes for
    implementing BIM. The goal of this research is to create that common
    language by developing a BIM Use Ontology. A BIM Use (Use) is defined as a
    method of applying Building Information Modeling during a facility's
    life-cycle to achieve one or more specific objectives. The BIM Use Ontology
    (the Ontology) provides a shared vocabulary that is applied to model (or
    express) the BIM Uses, including the type of objects (or terms), and
    concepts, properties, and relationships that exist. The methods performed to
    develop the BIM Use Ontology included: 1) defining domain and scope, 2)
    acquiring domain knowledge, 3) documenting domain terms, 4) integrating
    domain terms, 5) evaluating (refining and validating) the BIM Use Ontology,
    and 6) documenting the BIM Use Ontology. Overall, the BIM Use Ontology
    classified over 550 BIM terms into a defined ontological structure. Before
    the BIM Use Ontology was finalized, this structure was validated through
    competency questions, term mapping, industry interviews, and focus group
    meetings. The research methodology implemented to develop the BIM Use
    Ontology was designed based on the following criteria: clarity,
    comprehensiveness, extendibility, minimal bias, and minimal ontological
    commitment. The BIM Use Ontology primarily classifies the BIM Uses based on
    the purpose of implementing BIM on a facility or within an organization; and
    secondarily classifies BIM Uses based on characteristics of the BIM Use. The
    BIM Use Ontology classifies BIM Uses into five primary BIM Use Purposes: 1)
    Gather, 2) Generate, 3) Analyze, 4) Communicate, and 5) Realize. After the
    BIM Use Purpose is determined, an implementer can identify more detailed BIM
    Use Characteristics such as facility element, facility phase, author
    discipline, or level of development. Depending upon a particular
    implementation of BIM, the process, information, infrastructure, maturity,
    benefits, and references are determined. The characteristics make the BIM
    Use Ontology applicable and usable by industry. The BIM Use Ontology
    provides a structure for the purposes by which BIM can be implemented during
    the life-cycle of a facility. The BIM Use Ontology provides the fundamental
    terminology and organizational structure for the purposes for which BIM is
    implemented throughout the life-cycle of a facility. The BIM Use Ontology
    can be applied within procurement language and BIM planning to define exact
    requirements of various parties. The BIM Use Ontology can also be applied to
    standardize process and information exchanges. This standardization is
    critical to the U.S. National BIM Standard. Overall, the BIM Use Ontology
    allows for better communication of the purposes for implementing Building
    Information Modeling throughout the life of a facility.

  abstract: >-
    The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are a common file-based open standard
    to describe Building Information Models. An IFC file can describe a building
    model to a level of detail suitable for production use and unite information
    pertaining to all stakeholders involved in a construction project. IFC files
    can possibly constitute up to gigabytes of data. Processing the full extent
    of this data can be time consuming. Considering the multi-disciplinary
    nature of our industry it may also be unnecessary for the use case at hand.
    Therefore, the retrieval of relevant subsets, whether spatially, based on
    discipline, or others, is necessary to effectively consume such datasets in
    downstream applications.

    However, prevalent encoding forms of IFC models are text-based. And even
    though, in terms of file size, the most prevalent encoding, called IFC-SPF,
    can be rather efficient, by nature, it does not facilitate random access
    seeking in the file and no ordering is imposed to the definition of elements
    in the file. Therefore, at worst, the entire file needs to be traversed in
    order to find instances of interest. Furthermore, text-based data is slow to
    parse in comparison to its binary equivalent.

    This paper introduces a binary serialization for IFC models as an
    alternative to prevalent text-based formats. It is based on an existing open
    standard called HDF5. An implementation for the translation of conventional
    IFC instance models into HDF5 is provided under and open source license.
    HDF5 is a binary and hierarchical data format. The hierarchical nature
    allows random access to specific instances. Other benefits include
    transparent compression and mechanisms for linking and mounting external
    files. The compressed HDF5 format yields a significant reduction of file
    sizes as compared to IFC-SPF models. In three use cases is assessed that
    extracting data from the model, can occur in near-constant time in relation
    to the size of the model, contrary to linear time using IFC-SPF models.

    The translation into HDF5 files follows an existing ISO standardized mapping
    from EXPRESS instance models, the parent standard of IFC. The
    self-documenting nature of HDF5 enables incorporating additional attributes
    that are not part of the schema. In order to improve visualisation one can
    cache calculated information such as triangulated geometry for complex CSG
    geometries that are computationally complex to compute. In addition,
    incorporating inverse attribute values as part of the instantiation allows
    to further optimize the generation of subgraphs.

    The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are a prevalent data model in which
    Building Information Models can be exchanged, typically with a file-based
    nature. Processing the full extent of these models can be time-consuming.
    Considering the multi-disciplinary nature of the construction industry,
    stakeholders will typically only be interested in a small subset, depending
    on the purpose of the exchange. Therefore, the retrieval of relevant
    subsets, whether spatially, based on discipline, or others, is necessary to
    effectively consume such datasets in downstream applications. Prevalent
    encoding forms of IFC models are text-based and do not facilitate
    random-access seeking within the file and do not impose an ordering on the
    definition of elements within the file. Therefore, typically, the entire
    file needs to be read in order to find the data of interest. Furthermore,
    text-based data is slower to parse in comparison to binary data. This paper
    assesses a binary serialization format originating from the family of
    EXPRESS standards. It is based on an existing open, binary, hierarchical
    data format called HDF5 that allows random access to specific instances and
    therefore efficient retrieval of relevant subsets. The block-level,
    transparent compression yields a reduction of file sizes as compared to
    traditional serializations. Fully specified datatypes embedded in the
    exchange guarantee interoperable use. In this paper, several serialization
    profiles are introduced that cater to specific use cases by governing
    storage settings. Advanced functionality from the HDF5 library is applied to
    offer novel paradigms for fine-grained access rights, varying level of
    detail, revision management and aggregation of aspect models.

    Multi-disciplinary and long-term use of geometric and semantic construction
    information

    With the transition to Building Information Modeling (BIM) within the
    construction

    sector, industry stakeholders exchange detailed building engineering
    information in

    semantic and computer readable formats. The Industry Foundation Classes
    (IFC) are

    the main open and vendor neutral standard according to which this
    information is

    structured. Open issues arise when extending and generalizing the use of IFC
    data

    to other related disciplines, such as cultural heritage documentation,
    digital long-

    term preservation, land registration and cadastral management, geospatial
    analysis,

    building asset management and civil engineering. These issues originate from
    the use

    of unrelated ontologies, mismatching levels of detail, different geometric
    modeling

    paradigms,inefficientstorageofinformation,lackoffullfeaturedquerylanguagesand

    no means for mutation management. This dissertation is aimed at alleviating
    some

    of the technical complications of multi-disciplinary and long-term use of
    building

    models.

    To provide more efficient storage mechanisms for IFC instance models, a
    binary

    format is introduced, based on the open HDF5 standard for scientific
    computing. Re-

    quired storage space and access times to specific information is decimated
    relating to

    the state of the art of clear-text encoding of exchange models, by means of
    the hier-

    archical and fixed-length storage of instances, an instantiation of inverse
    attributes,

    machine-native storage of number literals and transparently applied
    block-level com-

    pression. Storage space is reduced to as little as 11% of original encoding
    for large

    models, but the most profound reduction is in access times to descriptive
    meta-data,

    whichcanbederivedinaslittleas0.0067%to3.5%ofthetimerequiredonthecurrently

    prevalent formats, for simple tasks and more elaborate tasks respectively.
    Due to the

    self-descriptive storage paradigm and optionally applied checksum filters,
    advances

    are made to resilient long-term digital storage. Advanced features such as
    internal ref-

    erences and mounting, assembling various files by the end-user, contribute
    to specific

    use cases in industry such as varying levels of detail and the aggregation
    of several

    aspect models provided independently by different stakeholders.

    Currently, the most viable options to query for information encoded in
    building

    models are provided by the standards and tools that are part of the Semantic
    Web

    ecosystem, with in particular RDF as a generic storage method and SPARQL as
    a

    query language. Those generic RDF tools are compared to querying the novel
    binary

    serialized models directly, with an implemented SPARQL query engine that
    operates

    directly on top of this format, eliminating additional indirections that
    stem from the

    RDF conversion process. No additional optimization or indexing step is
    necessary as

    opposed to the state of the art RDF storage engines, due to the efficient
    storage. As

    such, the approach presented in this dissertation yields the most succinct
    queryable

    format for BIM models and is fastest in some of the cases where query paths
    follow

    the direction in which attributes are defined in IFC.

    Due to the complicated and implicit definitions of the geometric engineering
    con-

    structs in BIM models, querying and reasoning on such geometric constructs
    directly

    without a prior evaluation step is not feasible. Especially in the context
    of the Se-

    mantic Web, such constructs cannot be efficiently stored due to the use of
    ordered

    sequences for example for polygonal boundaries. In this dissertation an
    alternative

    description of IFC geometries is provided as Well-Known Text, a standard
    originating

    from the geospatial domain for human readable and explicit geometry
    definitions

    with well-defined semantics and relational predicates. Comparing to the
    original

    RDF representation of IFC, for specific files, a reduction in triple counts
    of up to 96% is

    achieved. Formoregeneralfilesfromindustryreductionsof44%and52%arerealized.

    Procedures are provided to translate the product-centric solid geometries of
    build-

    ing elements into representations that cater to other modeling paradigms,
    such as (a)

    thermal analysis, where thin-walled interfaces between thermal zones are
    required

    and (b) geospatial analysis where a complete manifold building envelope is
    desired

    for topological and geometrical queries.

    from acquisition devices. For this purpose a minimal schema extension is
    provided

    that, with an addition of 13 new entities, enables to efficiently express,
    annotate and

    link point cloud segments to individual building elements. Due to the
    various inde-

    pendent layers of compression: grid discretization, quantization and general
    purpose

    compression at the file format level, a 68% compression ratio is obtained
    compared

    to the independent storage of point cloud and building model separately. In
    addi-

    tion to change detection, the confluence of point cloud and building model
    facilitates

    use cases such as structural health monitoring to assess the gradual
    deflections that

    elements incur over time and hybrid modeling approaches for detailed

    To date, widely implemented and full-featured query languages for building
    models in their native exchange formats do not exist. While interesting
    proposals exist for querying Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models, their
    functionality is often incomplete and their semantics not precisely defined.
    With the introduction of the ifcOWL ontology as an equivalent to the IFC
    schema in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), an option to represent such
    models in RDF (Resource Description Framework, a general information
    modeling method) is provided, and such models can be queried using SPARQL
    (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). The size of data sets in complex
    building projects, however, renders the use of clear-text encoded RDF
    infeasible in many cases. A SPARQL implementation, compatible with ifcOWL,
    is proposed, directly atop a standardized binary serialization format for
    IFC building models. This novel format is the binary equivalent of
    traditional IFC serialization formats but with more compact storage and less
    overhead than the graph serialization in RDF. The format is based on ISO
    10303-26 and relies on an open standard for organizing large amounts of
    data: Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5). Due to hierarchical
    partitioning and fixed-length records, only small subsets of the data are
    read to answer queries, improving efficiency. A prototypical implementation
    of the query engine is provided in the Python programming language. In
    several realistic use cases, the proposed system performs equivalent to or
    better than the state of the art in SPARQL querying on building models. For
    large datasets, the proposed storage format results in files that are 2–3
    times smaller than the current, most concise, RDF databases while offering a
    platform-neutral, containerized exchange file.

    BimQL is an open, domain specific query language for Building Information
    Models (BIM). This query language is intended for selecting and updating
    data stored in Industry Foundation Class (IFC) models. Even though some
    partial solutions already have been suggested, none of them are open source,
    domain specific, platformindependent and implemented at the same time. The
    report presents an overview of existing approaches, the design decisions,
    the implementation on top of the BimServer.org platform, which is an open
    source model server, and functionality tests. The execution of example test
    cases show the general feasibility and scalability of the approach chosen.

    This study aims to design and implement a domain-specific computer
    programming language: the Building Environment Rule and Analysis (BERA)
    Language. As a result of the growing area of Building Information Modeling
    (BIM), there has been a need to develop highly customized domain-specific
    programming languages for handling issues in building models in the
    architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. The BERA Language
    attempts to deal with building information models in an intuitive way in
    order to define and analyze rules in design stages. The application of the
    BERA Language aims to provide efficiency in defining, analyzing and checking
    rules. Specific example applications implemented in this dissertation are on
    the evaluation of two key aspects: building circulation and spatial
    programming.  
     
    The objective of this study is to accomplish an effectiveness and ease of
    use without precise knowledge of general-purpose languages that are
    conventionally used in BIM software development. To achieve the goal, this
    study proposes an abstraction of the universe of discourse - it is the BERA
    Object Model (BOM). It is a human-centered abstraction of complex state of
    building models rather than the computation-oriented abstraction. By using
    BOM, users can enjoy the ease of use and portability of BIM data, rather
    than complex and platform-dependent data structures. This study also has
    reviewed and demonstrated its potential for extensibility of BOM. Not only
    its lateral extensions such as structural building elements, but also the
    vertical extensions such as additional properties for existing BOM objects
    are good examples. In current BERA Language Tool, many computed and derived
    properties/relations have been proposed and implemented, as well as some
    basic data directly from the given building model.  
     
    Target users of the BERA Language are domain experts such as architects,
    designers, reviewers, owners, managers, students, etc., rather than BIM
    software developers. It means that the people who are interested in the
    building environment rule and analysis are the potential users. The BERA
    Language Tool comprises many libraries to alleviate common but unnecessary
    problems and limitations that are encountered when users attempt to analyze
    and evaluate building models using commercially available tools. Combined
    with other libraries which populate rich and domain-specific datasets for
    certain purposes, the BERA Language will be fairly versatile to define rules
    and analyze various building environmental conditions.

    With the boom in building information modeling, the need for an automated
    rule-based design checking has increased to elevate the speed of design
    requirement evaluation pertaining to building rules, regulations, and other
    necessary requirements. Over the past decade, various efforts to develop an
    efficient rule-based checking process and platform have been made in
    different countries. Even though there is one commercial tool named Solibri
    Model Checker, none so far has been advanced enough to fully automate the
    design checking process and meet the requirements of the industry. This
    study aims at investigating and comparing the current rule-based design
    checking approaches including IfcDoc, KBim, ePlanCheck, ACABIM, and SNACC,
    identifying the similarities and the differences of the existing approaches.
    The authors who have been involved in each process of rule-checking tool
    development had a long discussion regarding their experience and lessons
    learned and found that the five approaches were based on a similar process
    and method to translate requirements, define rules, check design procedures,
    develop validation features, and report checking results.

    This paper describes a BIM-enabled spatial analysis approach that enables us
    to compute specific quantitative data using BERA (Building Environment Rule
    and Analysis) Language and its tool. By comparing design alternatives for an
    actual building model, this paper also demonstrates building circulation and
    its associated properties of numeric data. The conventional software-driven
    approaches have intrinsic limitations that include limited interfaces,
    restricted parameters, closed rules except pre-defined rules, etc. A script
    language-based approach, however, is strongly necessary for various and
    flexible design review tasks especially for retrieving and computing
    specific dataset. This paper specifically demonstrates actual design review
    tasks as follows: 1) comparison and visualization of the differences between
    design alternatives in terms of their different spatial allocations; 2)
    analyzing numeric data result, NDBC (Numeric Data of Building Circulation),
    for evaluation of building circulation factors in each department of
    building; and as a result, 3) overall quantitative analysis and its result
    will be reported on given actual BIM models in order to support design
    decision making among various spatial allocation scenarios. For the actual
    demonstration presented in this paper, we modified some part of BERA
    language applications and defined appropriate BERA program code and Java
    code that are executable on given BIM models.

    A well building design support system can not only meet the rules but also
    automatically recommend the appropriate alternatives for designers, but most
    modifications now are conducted in the manual way. Although the method of
    automatic rule checking can effectively identify the compliance of rules in
    Building Information Modeling (BIM) models, recommendation supports are
    still lacked in applications. This paper aims to propose a design support
    system, using automatic rule checking to identify the compliance of rules
    and adopting case-based reasoning to provide recommendations via ontology
    and semantics. The AHP-TOPSIS (Analytic hierarchy process-Technique for
    Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method is used to give
    reliable recommendations rank. A real case is adopted as an illustrative
    example. Results show that the proposed system can increase the design
    efficiency in both design checking and modifying. Similar applications can
    be extended to other fields and rules.

    This paper describes an implementation process for a domain-specific
    computer programming language: the Building Environment Rule and Analysis
    (BERA) Language. As the growing area of Building Information Modeling (BIM),
    there has been a need to develop highly customized domain-specific languages
    for handling issues in building models in the architecture, engineering and
    construction (AEC) industry sector. The BERA Language, one of the
    domain-specific languages, deals with building information models in an
    intuitive way in order to ensure the quality of design and assess the design
    programming requirements using user-defined rules in the early design
    phases. To accomplish these goals, the BERA Language provides the
    capabilities for an effectiveness and ease of use without precise knowledge
    of general-purpose languages that are conventionally used in BIM software
    development. Furthermore, the design and implementation of the BERA Language
    focuses on building objects and their associated information-rich properties
    and relationships. This paper represents the implementation issues of the
    BERA Language associated with the building information models, their mapping
    into the building data structure, and their instantiation and execution. In
    addition, Portability of the language, extensibility and platform-dependent
    issues are involved in the BERA Language implementation. The implementation
    described in this paper is based on the use of Industry Foundation Classes
    (IFC) as given building information models, Solibri Model Checker® (SMC) as
    an IFC engine, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as a compilation and
    execution environment.

    Abstract Defect data contains knowledge about specific work conditions. In
    order to prevent reoccurrence of defects, a data feedback mechanism is
    required. However, most defect data are stored in unstructured ways,
    resulting in the fundamental problem of data utilization. This paper
    proposes a novel framework by using BIM and linked data technologies for
    sharing defect data between heterogeneous data sources in a new way. To
    demonstrate, a defect ontology is developed, work context information is
    extracted from BIM models, extracted BIM data is converted to RDF format,
    and SPARQL queries are implemented. The proposed approach could help BIM
    software applications to take into account information stemming from the
    defect management domain. Also, it can reduce data search time and improve
    the accuracy of search results as well. Therefore, this framework may enable
    reductions of defect occurrence and improvements in current defect
    management practices.

    and the IFC server ActiveX component, allows users to define various types

    the MVD.

    Each domain industry requires the detailed specifications for sharing and
    exchanging building information models throughout the design, construction,
    and operation phases. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) Model View
    Definitions (MVDs) specify required information for exchanges of building
    model data among building project experts. The data involves the
    identification of model semantics shared by two or more applications.
    However, since no robust standard for defining building semantics and
    requirements for data exchange has been agreed upon, information embedded in
    domain-specific MVDs are generated separately and are vague in scope, which
    results in a lack of consistency. In addition, the Information Delivery
    Manual (IDM) that includes exchange specifications needed for each exchange
    process of a product model is manually defined in a paper-based document.
    Because there is no clear logical link between the units of information in
    the exchange requirements of an IDM, and those of MVDs, the mapping that
    translates requirements of an IDM into ones of an MVD is open to various
    interpretation, without semantic and logical consistency. Such challenges
    might result in redundant requirements and rules for data exchange that are
    not supposed to be handled in the process of MVDs. To ameliorate this
    situation, this research proposes the new approach of formalizing domain
    knowledge and defining accurate data modules for model views. To achieve
    this goal, the authors employed ontological principles for generating an IDM
    for the precast concrete domain and for linking its MVD with formal
    information models. The formalized structure of domain knowledge is expected
    to support defining explicit data modules and developing manageable
    relationships among entities using semantic reasoning so that domain
    professionals and software vendors can identify the intents of the
    requirements of mapped MVDs and keep track of mapping problems. Moreover, to
    integrate IDM and MVD development processes, the ontology-based IDM is
    parsed and translated from OWL/XML to mvdXML, which automatically generates
    MVD documentation in the IfcDoc tool.

    An ontology-based approach for developing data exchange requirements and

  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    In this paper, we describe an approach to translating the written content of
    the Korean Building Act into a computer-executable format for the purpose of
    evaluating building permit requirements. Among the various applications of
    building information modeling (BIM), we focus on automated design assessment
    and its rule-making process, which has been performed by both architects and
    software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach,
    which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism
    (KBimLogic) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into
    computer-executable code (KBimCode) is a software-independent approach that
    separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the
    rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit
    code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related
    regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the
    sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation
    into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building
    permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district,
    permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable
    rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit
    system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical
    that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such
    fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by
    non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The
    scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases
    classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building
    Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual
    rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural
    language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this
    approach has been demonstrated by each database and a GUI-based application
    named KBimLogic, for generating KBimCode. The KBimCode, which contains a set
    of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be
    imported into our code-checking software (KBimAssess) using a specific file
    format.

    During the design and construction phases of building projects, domain
    experts iteratively exchange building information models. One of their goals
    is to ensure that the requirements and objectives of a proposed project are
    satisfied. In addition, most building information modeling software
    currently implements heterogeneous mapping processes in their IFC interfaces
    that bind their native models to the IFC format. However, such exchanges
    frequently do not realize intended geometric transformations, project
    requirements, and required syntactic and semantic conditions in building
    model data, exacerbating the problem of model integrity and resulting in
    expensive changes during the construction and operation phases. These
    problematic issues have been addressed by the development of solid
    frameworks for validating a building design. This paper surveys six
    currently available applications for validating building design data and
    identifies their strengths and weaknesses: The Express Engine's EXPRESSO,
    the JDSAI™, the EXPRESS Data Manager™, the IFC server ActiveX Component, the
    IfcDoc, and the Solibri Model Checker®. We also structured the validation
    processes into three types of tasks: 1) a syntax check of the assurance of
    compliance with the IFC schema defined by the EXPRESS language, 2) semantic
    and syntactic assessment in terms of conformity to model view definitions,
    which consist of concept modularizations, and 3) the validation of design
    programming requirements that evaluates regulations, project criteria, owner
    requirements, and functional performance. The purpose of this survey, based
    on available software that supports the validation of building model data
    for these three types of interoperability issues, is to integrate diverse
    checking approaches, as a basis for improving what are now widely
    distributed efforts.

  abstract: >-
    There has been considerable interest in Building Information Modeling (BIM)
    research and development during the last decade. BIM has established itself
    as a field of research in (and beyond) scientific communities interested in
    information technologies in construction. Interestingly, the contours of BIM
    as a scientific field are still not clearly identified. Several studies have
    recently tried to analyze different aspects of this issue, without providing
    a systematic and comprehensive methodological approach to accurately define
    the major themes and clusters of the BIM domain. This paper uses a
    systematic literature review approach to map the BIM research themes and
    clusters over ten years of scientific publications. 1244 articles published
    in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2016 were selected and the
    associated metadata analyzed in order to highlight co-occurrences in
    author’s keywords. It appears that a few “big players” dominate the
    keywords, while most of the keywords used by authors are much less cited.
    Seven core clusters are identified using modularity optimization techniques:
    industry foundation classes, information technology, facility management,
    building, collaboration, computer aided design, and laser scanning.

    We present a new approach and a prototype software engine for defeasible
    reasoning to support automated building code compliance checking. The
    challenge with formalising defeasible rules in a purely deductive reasoning
    system is the resulting exponential blow up of the rule set due to the need
    to explicitly state numerous combinations of exception cases. This leads to
    a rule set that is brittle, complicated, difficult to understand, and
    obscures the central point of a given normative provision. Moreover,
    assessing compliance, to any degree, in the absence of complete information
    about a building, down to the smallest detail, is very limited in a purely
    deductive setting in which nothing can be assumed. We empirically evaluate
    our prototype reasoning engine on an IFC model of a building in
    Christchurch, New Zealand, for compliance with accessibility criteria from
    the New Zealand Building Code.

    The e-COGNOS platform presents the first comprehensive ontology-based portal
    for knowledge management in the construction domain. The main features of
    the platform are an ontology (to encapsulate human knowledge) and a set of
    web services to support the management of ontology (creation, updates), user
    management (profiling) and handling knowledge management requirements
    (indexing, documentation, retrieval and dissemination). Implementation of
    e-COGNOS platform (at leading European construction organizations) has
    proven the benefit of semantic systems as they provided adequate search and
    indexing capabilities, allowed for a systematic procedure for formally
    documenting and updating organizational knowledge (through the ontology) and
    enhanced the customization functions in a knowledge management systems
    (through user profiling). The development and implementation of the e-COGNOS
    platform has also shown that the managerial aspect of knowledge management
    (in terms of integrating knowledge in daily processes and the link between
    knowledge and organizational structure) is harder to attain.

    We present a methodology and prototype software framework to formalise
    normative provisions related to building design and construction to support
    automated compliance audit processes of ISO-standard building information
    models (BIM). Our framework is based on the declarative Answer Set
    Programming (ASP) logic programming language that we extend to support
    optimised geometric and spatial reasoning. We address three key challenges
    in formalising building codes: (1) Ambiguity and qualitative aspects of
    modern performance-based building codes, e.g. "Essential information on
    wayfinding must be easy to see, read and understand (BR15)"; "There shall be
    no direct line of sight between an access route and a WC (NZBC-G1)". Our
    framework supports integrated layers of abstraction (in the context of
    ontologies and knowledge engineering) in order to ground how behavioural and
    human-centred terms such as "easy to see" and "access route" are ultimately
    defined based on results from cognitive psychology and declarative spatial
    reasoning. (2) Managing a relatively large code base that can support
    maintainability, extensibility, traceability, and transparency, i.e. a
    particular code definition can be easily traced back to research literature
    used for its formalisation, and indeed multiple alternative definitions can
    be implemented and checked simultaneously. (3) Keeping the computational
    runtime efficient for practical applications, despite processing a large
    number of codes and a large size of real-world building models. We present
    empirical results (including real building models from New Zealand) to
    demonstrate that formalised codes definitions can focus exclusively on the
    semantics without mixing in "tricks" to make them computationally faster for
    handling a large-scale BIM, which is often at the cost of clarity and code
    base maintainability, etc. Thus, we leverage the declarative character of
    ASP to achieve a total separation of (a) semantic definition from (b)
    computational runtime efficiency of conformance checking.

    With the rapidly growing number of online product models in construction
    industry, there is an urgent need for developing effective domain-specific
    information retrieval methods. Explicit semantic analysis (ESA) is a method
    that automatically extracts concept-based features from human knowledge
    repositories for semantic retrieval. This avoids the requirement of
    constructing and maintaining an explicitly formalized ontology. However,
    since domain-specific knowledge repositories are relatively small, the
    available terminologies are insufficient and concepts have coarse
    granularity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ESA method for product
    model retrieval in construction industry. The major enhancements for the
    original ESA method consist of two parts. First, a novel concept expansion
    algorithm is proposed to solve the problem caused by insufficient
    terminologies. Second, a reranking algorithm is developed to solve the
    problem caused by coarse granularity of concepts. Experimental results show
    that our method significantly improves the performance of product model
    retrieval and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also
    applicable to product retrieval in other engineering domain if a specific
    knowledge repository is provided in that domain.

    In AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Owner-operated)
    industry information are mainly defined and exchanged in natural language
    through textual files and documents. On the contrary, a Building Information
    Modeling (BIM) approach requires machine processable data and information.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows to process textual information into
    structured format. About BIM in AECO industry, and NLP in different sectors,
    several literature reviews have been conducted. However, none of them
    highlighted the possible connections between the two topics. This study
    provides a scientometric analysis aiming to investigate possible combined
    applications of BIM and NLP. A quantitative literature review approach is
    employed, using data visualization and science mapping applied on
    bibliometric meta-data. The performed analysis uncovered possible directions
    for further research on NLP and BIM combined applications in AECO sector.
    Most active authors, key research patterns, and institutional affiliations
    are identified. The main applications areas of a combined NLP and BIM
    approach in AECO are: Information Retrieval and Information Enrichment of
    BIM models, Automatic Compliance Checking, and Safety and Risk Management.
    The keywords pattern analysis highlighted the main tools which allows to
    link Semantic BIM and NLP methods and technologies, i.e. Ontology and
    Machine Learning algorithms. The scientometric analysis also reveals a gap
    related to the Preliminary design and Requirement definition phases,
    highlighting a possible research area not covered by the Academia as of now.

    In this paper, we develop an ontology-based framework for energy management
    in buildings. We divide the functional architecture of a building energy
    management system into three interconnected modules that include building
    management system (BMS), benchmarking (BMK), and evaluation &amp; control
    (ENC) modules. The BMS module is responsible for measuring several useful
    environmental parameters, as well as real-time energy consumption of the
    building. The BMK module provides the necessary information required to
    understand the context and cause of building energy efficiency or
    inefficiency, and also the information which can further differentiate
    normal and abnormal energy consumption in different scenarios. The ENC
    module evaluates all the information coming from BMS and BMK modules, the
    information is contextualized, and finally the cause of energy
    inefficiency/abnormality and mitigating control actions are determined.
    Methodology to design appropriate ontology and inference rules for various
    modules is also discussed. With the help of actual data obtained from three
    different rooms in a commercial building in Singapore, a case study is
    developed to demonstrate the application and advantages of the proposed
    framework. By mitigating the appropriate cause of abnormal inefficiency, we
    can achieve 5.7%, 11.8% and 8.7% energy savings in Room 1, Room 2, and Room
    3 respectively, while creating minimum inconvenience for the users.

    Compared with other industries, the use of big data is substantially less
    developed in the architecture, construction, engineering, and operation
    (AECO) industry. Available examples are mostly experimental, limited in
    scope, and without an obvious transfer to practice. Yet, a substantial
    number of academics and practitioners envision that the use of big data will
    have a significant impact on how decisions are made in the building design
    process, providing designers with an unprecedented amount of exceptionally
    detailed data on buildings and their occupants that is redefining what can
    be observed, modeled, simulated, predicted and measured in the industry. We
    first review the main concepts and technologies that shape this
    technological phenomenon, and then, based on the survey of around 100 cases
    of applications of big data and machine learning throughout all phases of
    building design we identify 12 clusters of applications where the technology
    seems to be more disruptive. The discussion then focuses on the
    transformative impacts of the technology on three niches where further
    research is more urgently needed: 1) understanding the design problem; 2)
    simulating and predicting the holistic performance of the design solution;
    3) evaluating integrally and continuously the design product during its
    complete lifecycle.

    Safety management is the most important part of the construction management
    on building engineering which has dynamic work environment and complicated
    construction procedure. Safety checking which identifies hazards before they
    occur is a core process of safety management on construction sites. However,
    the traditional construction safety checking which is operated by the
    experienced manager is manual and time-consuming. In order to integrate new
    technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for
    construction safety checking i.e. CSCOntology (Construction Safety Checking
    Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using
    an ontology language, OWL for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety
    checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation
    provisions are represented with a rule language, SWRL. Then the construction
    safety checking processes are implemented in the JESS, a rule engine for the
    Java platform by transforming OWL knowledge into JESS facts, and SWRL
    constraints into JESS rules. A real-world example has been demonstrated in
    Protégé 3.4 beta to show the proposed safety checking process, according to
    the regulation examples taken from “29 CFR 1926 OSHA Construction Industry
    Regulations”.

  abstract: >-
    In the past, building information modeling (BIM) in general and building
    performance simulation (BPS) in particular have developed and deployed
    fairly detailed representations of building geometry, fabric, construction,
    and technology. Relatively less attention has been paid to the
    representations of building users. Thereby, one of the key challenges
    concerns the matching between the nature and level of building-related
    performance queries on the one hand and the required or appropriate
    resolution of applied occupant models. This paper addressed this challenge
    via a two-fold path: A “top-down” path examines the ontological scope of
    comprehensive, theory-driven representations of building occupants. Such
    representations could be presumably condensed so as to match the
    informational requirements of specific performance queries. On the other
    hand, a “bottom-up” path involves the reverse-engineering of typical
    building performance simulation tools, focusing thereby on the implicit
    schema rooted in the tool's input modalities vis-à-vis occupant information.
    The top-down path can inform the definition of a common schema for
    occupant-related information. The bottom-up reverse-engineering can provide
    a reality check in view of the ontological depth of common occupant
    representations in analysis tools. The pursuit of these paths is suggested
    to highlight a gap between behavioral domain knowledge and default occupant
    representation in BIM and the analysis of this gap can facilitate the
    derivation of related ontologies.

    Building designs in countries such as the United Kingdom are currently

    that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this
    can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the
    overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and
    Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD)
    drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the
    development of automated compliance checking systems for building
    regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of
    compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC
    has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However,
    whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the
    England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to
    automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted
    from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable
    rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code
    compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and
    focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that
    relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently
    optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a
    Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate
    for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for
    England and Wales.

    The activities of briefing (stating problems to be solved) and designing
    (instantiating solutions) are intimately interlinked – both parts of the
    same process to develop and procure a product which satisfies one or more
    needs. There is an on-going “conversation” between problem (requirement)
    definition and design proposal in which acceptable proposals progressively
    add to, and refine, the definition of the whole solution while at the same
    time potentially generating further problems to be resolved. At any point in
    time through this process, the developed whole solution is composed of
    partial solutions which form the context against which further problem
    statements are made. These problem statements are indicators for a future
    desired state of the whole solution. The design briefing process also can be
    seen as starting before professional designers are involved and continues
    after they complete their project contribution, so retaining design
    intentions alongside solutions is valuable for the on- going use of a
    designed product. With these ideas as background, this paper investigates
    the hypothesis that data for briefing and design can be usefully correlated
    within integrated building information data models. Several extensions are
    proposed to the IFC data schema that formalise the way requirements can be
    modelled. It is then shown how rule-based checking of solutions can be
    implemented against requirements defined in this way.

    In recent years, infrastructure restoration has been backlogged with complex
    factors that have captured the attention of municipal and federal
    authorities in North America and Europe. The subjective nature of evaluating
    bridge conditions and bridge deterioration is one of the main factors that
    influences bridge maintenance, repair, and replacement (MR&R) decisions.
    This study presents a stochastic fuzzy logic decision support integrated
    with a bridge information management system (BrIMS) to forecast bridge
    deteriorations and prioritize maintenance, repair, and replacement (MR&R)
    decisions at the conceptual design stage. The proposed system considers
    numerous factors that influence the prioritization of bridge MR&R decision
    making including complex time-dependent gamma shock models. A parametric
    analysis is conducted in order to quantify the degree of accuracy of the
    system. Implementation of the system platform demonstrated the viability of
    integrating BrIMS with fuzzy-logic deterioration forecast techniques at the
    conceptual stage of bridge design. The proposed system is validated through
    a case study and found to be in agreement with actual bridge deterioration
    results with a percentage difference of approximately 10 - 15 %. Besides
    that, the integrated platform may be utilized as a forecasting tool that is
    capable of predicting and prioritizing MR&R decisions to components for
    diverse bridge design alternatives.

    Abstract The integration of operational information in building life-cycle
    management is a relevant topic within the facilities management domain. A
    previous study proposed a methodology based on Building Information
    Modelling (BIM) and Facility Management (FM) systems integration,
    underpinned by a Performance Information Model, to support the performance
    assessment and the maintenance management. The purpose of this paper is to
    extend and validate that methodology with an open standard approach. A
    subset of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema related to
    performance assessment and maintenance procedures is mapped into a
    relational database. The database supports the integration between BIM
    models and facilities information systems. Case studies including healthcare
    buildings test the database and a new application. The results contribute to
    the BIM adoption in the FM domain. Also, the studied and validated IFC
    schema subset can be considered as a contribution to the Model View
    Definition for FM.

    Recent advances in Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies have
    resulted in a rising demand for real applications of this kind of tools, in
    addition to the usual standard functions. Building design code-checking is a
    task that has been found to be suitable for automation, allowing for
    swifter, more rigorous and transparent procedures. This paper presents
    research conducted at the University of Porto that has resulted in an
    original method and a software application for the automated code-checking
    of building water network designs. Although the methods are based on the
    main Portuguese regulations, they may be adapted to other countries. The
    paper presents a review of the core principles behind BIM-based automated
    code-checking, and discusses the role of the IFC model as a viable format
    for the exchange of data in a code-checking system, as well as current
    international automated code-checking initiatives. The authors conclude that
    automated code-checking procedures can be feasibly implemented in the short
    term in some domains, and that they may provide a significant incentive
    towards widespread BIM adoption.

    In this paper we present the on-going development of a framework for a
    domain specific, open query language for building information models. The
    proposed query language is intended for selecting, updating and deleting of
    data stored in Industry Foundation Classes models. Even though some partial
    solutions already have been suggested, none of them are open source, domain
    specific, platform independent and implemented at the same time. This paper
    provides an overview of existing approaches, conceptual sketches of the
    language in development and documents the current state of implementation as
    a prototype plugin developed for the open source model server platform
    bimserver.org. We report on the execution of example test-cases to show the
    general feasibility of the approach chosen.

    The notion of advancing levels of adequate regulatory compliance within the
    domain of construction and engineering is by no means a new phenomenon. An
    extensive degree of effort has over a number of decades previously focused
    on semi/fully automating design checking against regulatory building codes.
    After experiencing somewhat of a dip in popularity within academia, this
    research topic is once again of great interest due to the on-going adoption
    of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the construction domain among
    other drivers like frequent updates to building regulatory documents
    particularly in relation to sustainability related issues like energy
    efficiency of buildings. This interest will only increase as we witness
    further widespread adoption of this new BIM paradigm across until now
    untouched disciplines. Unfortunately design checking within the remit of BIM
    still faces major problems with respect to national and local regulations as
    no sustainably sensible or scalable method has yet been implemented to
    ensure compliance rules are consistent with current legislation within these
    contexts. This work questions a suitable representational data format for UK
    construction and engineering regulations focusing on machine processable
    formats built entirely on open data standards which can then set the basis
    for addressing the aforementioned issues. We compare two existing
    legislation data models, namely the Crown Legislation Markup Language (CLML)
    and Akoma Ntoso, whilst in the process grading each on its suitability for
    most accurately accommodating and expressing the domain and profession
    specific nature of typical building regulations. The study conclusions
    indicate that the design, management and current availability of the CLML
    has resulted in a scenario where barriers exist to widespread adoption, this
    includes building out community in support of the language. Akoma Ntoso on
    the other hand has focused on building community around the proposed
    standard. This increases the likelihood of phased organisational transition
    towards the standard for achieving improved representational data modelling.

    Geometric data plays a central role in the geospatial domain, architectural
    design and construction industry. For upcoming, new approaches to store
    building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement
    exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can
    therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading
    to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data
    available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on
    the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a
    common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing
    and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed,
    i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the
    OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general
    contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific
    use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this
    paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry
    representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web.
    Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical
    constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from
    different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is
    generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this
    paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified,
    tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling,
    which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we
    recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry
    representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases
    appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen
    based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and
    exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of
    all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective
    challenges.

    Abstract. This paper presents a model for representing compliance rules
    related to subsurface objects. Rules expressed in this model can be
    automatically evaluated (using SHACL or SPARQL) on existing 3D city models
    expressed in RDF. The main characteristics of the proposed model are (1) its
    expressiveness, that comes from the use of formal ontologies for
    representing the rules and the objects they refer to, (2) its integrative
    nature, given by the interconnection among the proposed ontologies and the
    connection of these ontologies with CityGML and IFC (in an ontological
    form), and (3) its multi-geometry aspect. Preliminary results allow to
    automatically evaluate formally expressed compliance rules for underground
    objects in a 3D city model, that will considerably ease the task of
    professionals of the field.

  abstract: >-
    The semantic design rules are developed to represent the denotation of
    elements and the relationships between these elements. Under the scope of
    BIM-SPEED project, semantics are useful to ‘translate’ experts’ knowledge
    about buildings regulations into a language that can be understandable by
    data experts. Once this knowledge is translated to a computer-based
    language, the rules are accommodated to the model checker tool, where an
    automatic regulation compliance checking is performed. The purpose of the
    checking process is to warn the users for possible failures, as well as to
    propose them alternative renovation objects that comply with the rules and
    can be integrated to their designs.


    The design rules focus on the most typical elements for renovation in a
    residential building, covering the building envelope (roof, wall, windows),
    HVAC systems (boiler replacement, wall radiators) and common use elements
    such as stairs and corridors. The semantics include information on four
    basic criteria: thermal and acoustic comfort, fire

    safety and accessibility.

    On May 17, 2019, Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications
    started analyzing the possibilities for automating the building permit
    process using BIM-based workflows. The purpose of the project is to find out
    the technical requirements for implementing a BIM-based process in EHR
    (Estonian Building Registry), to specify verifiable claim types, to create a
    Proof of Concept and User Interaction (UX) mock-ups of the EHR user
    interface. The project was made in collaboration with a Dutch consulting
    company Future Insight and was funded by the European Commission Structural
    Reform Support Program.

    Project reports and presentations are attached as documents at the end of
    the page.

    Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provide safer, greener, and more
    convenient mobility, while reducing the impact on the environment. In recent
    years, simulation platforms have been employed to study ITS applications,
    mostly focusing on traffic-related simulations. Despite several research
    studies on ITS applications and simulation platforms, formal semantic
    descriptions of intelligent transportation systems have not been addressed
    yet. In this paper, a semantic model describing intelligent transportation
    systems for roads is proposed. The semantic model is devised to provide a
    basis for designing ITS simulation platforms. Building upon the semantic
    model, an extension to an open building information modeling (BIM) standard,
    i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema, is presented. The IFC
    schema extension is verified and validated using a BIM-based simulation
    scenario of ITS for roads. It is shown that the proposed IFC-compliant
    description of ITS for roads provides a formal basis for generating
    BIM-based simulations and hence facilitates ITS infrastructure modeling in
    BIM projects. It is concluded that the present work represents a cornerstone
    for designing BIM-based ITS simulation platforms. In future endeavors,
    potential standardization and formalization efforts may be discussed.

    Intelligent transportation systems, representing core components of smart
    cities, combine sensing, computing, and wireless communication technologies
    to provide efficient and convenient mobility. Road intelligent
    transportation systems (ITS) have been studied in recent decades through
    simulation platforms that integrate computational models for various use
    cases, such as traffic lights control and management. However, semantic
    descriptions, illustrating road ITS as a whole and creating a basis for
    designing simulation platforms, have not been addressed. In this paper, a
    semantic model of road intelligent transportation systems is proposed, which
    describes road ITS components and architecture, serving as a formal basis
    for road ITS simulation platforms. Building upon the semantic model, an
    extension of the Industry Foundation Classes schema, facilitating ITS
    simulation platforms based on building information modeling, is discussed.
    The paper concludes with a summary, a discussion, and an outlook on
    potential formalization efforts.

    The reliable infrastructure of building automation (BA) systems forms the
    foundation of smart environments and energy systems in our building towards
    increasing occupant comfort and safety while reducing the ecological
    footprint of buildings. This is achieved through the processing of data
    points collected from sensors and the control of installed actuators, and
    increasingly incorporates machine learning components. However, engineering
    of BA systems is intricately linked with the planning, installation,
    (pre-)commissioning, and operation of building services such as HVAC, and it
    requires an extensive amount of manual coordination which is often prone to
    errors, many of which are only detected late in the lifecycle and tends to
    lose transparency in data provenance. To address this, we propose the
    application of DevOps, a highly successful paradigm in the field of software
    engineering, to BA engineering process coordination. In addition, the
    possibility of using semantic data to develop artifacts such as
    requirements, construction, and devices of BA systems opens up the avenue of
    achieving continuous verification of the system as it is built and
    commissioned. Concretely, we propose a novel approach that integrates a
    semantic reasoner using the machine-understandable data of the building
    along with interactions facilitated by Web of Thing Thing Description to the
    DevOps workflow. The proposed approach is expected to ameliorate limitations
    of existing workflow management methods and thus provide transparency in the
    data provenance to gain trust for data-driven AI applications for BA.

    Abstract In the existing building facilities context, the BIM substantial
    intervention concerning semantics and as-is information based portrayal for
    maintenance requirements is very confined. This confinement stresses the
    challenges associated with the lack and absence of reusing existing building
    facilities, as is domain knowledge. Within this scope, this paper proposes a
    novel approach for existing building facilities semantic-enrichment from
    indoor digital scanning portrayal phase to semantics depiction and
    management phase for renovation, rehabilitation, or restoration functions.
    In this paper, we present an ontological system, which relies on integrating
    the as-is information BIM and semantic web technology. The developed
    approach improves existing building facilities, as-is information
    formalization, and management for maintenance purposes. The paper outcome is
    a semantically integrated knowledge-based framework that can potentially: 1)
    constitute a semantic database for building facilities components as-is
    information using BIM; 2) overcome the lack and absence of retrieving and
    reusing building facilities as-is domain information; and (3) formalize the
    building facilities as-is knowledge in a computable way.

    Recently, Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies and, in
    particular, BIM servers proceeding with IFC-driven product data have become
    increasingly important in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC).
    However, a standard query language for IFC data has not yet been
    established, which prevents the interoperability between BIM applications
    and wider adoption of the IFC standard. In the paper requirements to an IFC
    query language are summarized with the focus on the compliance and
    harmonization with data definition and data manipulation languages which
    generally are the parts of a common data access interface. As a result of
    the study, the IFC query language was proposed and formalized. Using EXPRESS
    constructs and JSON structures, the language allows to specify complex
    predicative queries on object collections and recursive traversing queries
    on object networks. Explanatory examples of typical IFC queries are provided
    to illustrate the proposed language and prove its advantages.

    In this paper we document our approach on applying Behaviour-Driven
    Development

    (BDD) and Continuous Integration (CI) from the software industry to the
    construction sector. We

    have provided a freely available open software toolset for the application
    of rules in the Gherkin

    syntax to an IFC building model. A prominent aspect of BDD and contrary to
    mvdXML, the

    formalization of rules in plain-test human-readable scenarios provides a
    basis for collaborative

    formalization of rules among stakeholders. At the same time our approach
    includes imperative

    program code that is fully extensible to incorporate for example external
    data sources and

    geometrical reasoning. Runnings test on every model revision (the CI
    concept) as opposed to, for

    example, upon model delivery ensures a proactive approach to compliance.
    Reusing existing open

    source frameworks allowed us to build a comprehensive solution for
    continuous and automated

    model checking, visualization and reporting in several hundred lines of
    program code.

    In the last years the aec (architecture, engineering and construction)
    industry has been influenced by the development of building information
    modelling (bim). With the creation of complex systems, the need for
    efficient in­teroperability arises. Based on a study of bim interoperability
    dimensions and its levels, this research presents an inter­operability
    assessment of bim system in the structural domain, especially considering
    cast-in-place concrete structures, since they present some special
    challenges for system interoperability. This assessment was conducted by
    experiments that imported and exported structural models and structural
    elements through a non-proprietarz standard for bim mod­els (ifc- industry
    foundation classes). The experiments were conducted twice, with a five year
    gap from each other, so the evolution of the interoperability could be
    assessed as well. The results showed that some special characteristics must
    be considered in order to achieve efficient interoperability for
    cast-in-place concrete structures – these structures are monolithic and they
    have reinforcement steel bars that need detailing. Also, the research showed
    that in the five-year gap there were evolutions in interoperability, like in
    object identifiers, which had a considerable improvement. However, some of
    the major problems remain, such as overlapping of structural parts.

    Automation of the code compliance checking has been explored extensively,
    particularly in recent years with the emergence of building information
    modelling (BIM). Still, automated code compliance checking has not yet been
    fully realized, as there is no standardized method for rule interpretation
    and building model preparation for code compliance. Manual verification of
    design code compliance, meanwhile, requires significant effort and time and
    is error-prone, while uncertainty and inconsistency in assessment lead to
    delays in the construction process. In this paper, the development of a
    prototype to automate municipal bylaw and wall framing code compliance
    checking for residential building is presented. The building rules have been
    classified into three groups based on the complexity involved in translation
    into computer-readable format and complexity in retrieving the required
    information, and they are represented based on building objects, which makes
    the regulations easier to understand and assists in translating the
    regulations into a computer-readable format. By creating a model view based
    on the required element's parameters extracted from a model for checking
    purposes, the prototype application offers automated code compliance
    checking functionality to validate designs based on building code
    requirements and construction engineering specifications. The implementation
    of the prototype and its benefits compared to manual checking is
    demonstrated.

    Oil and Gas industrial plants commissioning processes are vital to assure
    quality and safety performance in operations. Also, reducing commissioning
    lead-time allows fast operation and more significant financial results.
    However, the on-site procedures of inspection and tests are mostly still
    managed by conventional ways paper-work-based, although some applications
    based on information technologies (e.g., tablets and PDF files) have already
    started to bring digital solutions to the field, that is not enough. Lacking
    interoperability is a persistent issue that inhibits process-oriented
    management. From this, CERTI Foundation, a Centres of Reference in
    Innovative Technologies, and an O&G Company from Brazil deployed a research
    and technological development project to implement a solution that allows
    middle-users to model and deploy on-site commissioning process-task-based.
    Also, workers and inspectors can receive and record on mobile devices the
    activities information. An Information Delivery Manual (IDM), ISO/DIS
    29481-1 (2014), is performed to capture the current business process
    integrating all stakeholders (e.g., O&G company, system providers, and new
    system developers). The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) ISO 16739:2018 is
    adopted as a neutral language and open data format to collaborate data
    between the new system developed for the owner O&G company and their
    suppliers to achieve high agility supply chains. An ifcJSON-4 version in
    sync with IFC EXPRESS Schema was developed to extend IFC to O&G
    Commissioning management information. It is totally queryable (CRUD
    operations) via REST API, allowing clients to access the exact information
    of interest. We have then translated the IFC data model into RDF, and we are
    currently working on semantic enrichment of the data in order to achieve new
    levels of queryable data and intelligent automatic inferences. This work
    presents the latest data schemas developed for the O&G sector and the proof
    of concepts conducted. Finally, the discussions lead to some conclusions as
    the commissioning processes need to be faster while maintaining security for
    workers, and the first step is standardising its information. Nothing is
    better than using neutral and universal formats, and IFC fits to achieve
    this. The second step is making the information available to end-users, and
    REST APIs to query IFC data do the work. The third step is to enrich the
    data model semantically, and again IFC might provide a shortcut to that by
    ifcOWL. We need then to continue the enrichment process by diving deeper
    into semantics and linked data in order to enable automatic inferences
    capability. The project's future directions are concerning the creation of a
    semantic web data model, which will be the basis for using AI in conjunction
    with a high-capacity data bus, to automatically detect bottlenecks in the
    commissioning process.

    covers current and emerging trends in automating the processes of examining
    building design against codes and standards of practice. The role of
    Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in these processes is
    thoroughly analyzed and explains how this new technology is significantly
    transforming modern architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
    domains. The book also introduces the theoretical background of
    computerizing compliance verification, including domain knowledge
    representations, building model representations, and automated code checking
    systems. An underlying goal for the material covered is to present the use
    of BIM technology as an integral part of the automated auditing process that
    can lead to a more comprehensive, intelligent, and integrated building
    design– a design where an optimized solution can be achieved in harmony with
    the current codes and standards of practice.


    This new proposed BIM-based framework for automating code conformance
    checking is one of the most powerful methods presently available to reflect
    actual building code requirements, and the methods described in the book
    offer significant benefits to the AEC industry

    As the mounting demand for building new residential and commercial units
    strikes the record, significant pressure from stakeholders investing in the
    construction industry has increasingly been requiring the government
    authorities to issue the construction permit in a timely manner. However,
    the architectural and engineering design review process is still mostly a
    time-consuming manual procedure. It involves assessing a design against
    codes and standards requirements to validate the accuracy and quality of the
    design and detecting errors before manufacturing and fabrication commences.
    Building design provisions are generally in the form of texts, charts,
    tables, and mathematical expressions. These regulations and guidelines
    usually have legal status. Thus, the computerization of this process
    represents a real challenge to the Architecture, Engineering, and
    Construction (AEC) industry. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides a
    platform for developing a virtual permitting process to improve the efficacy
    of issuing building permits by the authorities. This chapter reviews recent
    advancements in virtual permitting using BIM. Also, it presents data
    collected about the construction permitting process from Authority Having
    Jurisdiction (AHJ) plan reviewers, architects, engineers, and general
    contractors in the state of Florida. The primary goal is to tackle the
    problem by using the available data and technology to develop a BIM-driven
    Virtual Permitting System (VPS) to achieve design accuracy and permitting
    efficiency. The potential integration of VPS with blockchain will be
    discussed, along with benefits and limitations.

    Blockchain is a technology concept that originated from the first
    cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider
    range of applications beyond serving as the platform for digital
    cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized and an
    immutable ledger that records every transaction made in the network. The
    implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would result in
    augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate
    a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a
    decentralized, cooperative chain of command by encouraging trust and
    collaboration. This paper present examines the potential integration with
    the BIM process in advancing the automation of the design review process.
    Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology
    (DLT) could be advantageous in the automating the design review process by
    reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and
    management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The
    paper evaluates the potential application of blockchain technologies such as
    Smart Contracts in cybersecurity, data ownership and other aspects, as well
    as enhancing the framework for automating the design review process with a
    demonstration using Hyperledger Fabric.

    The process of detailed design and construction of building systems made of
    a large number of components is quite involved. Further, since design is an
    open-ended problem (i.e., in general, there are a large number of design
    alternatives satisfying code provisions) the selection of the optimum design
    becomes an extremely challenging activity. The key approach to this problem
    is harnessing automation technologies beyond the traditional application of
    Building Information Modeling (BIM). The main focus of this paper is to
    discuss the development and interplay between Smart Codes and BIM and their
    role in simplifying and enhancing the design process. This includes studying
    the Smart Codes implementation in building design, BIM model requirements
    and their interaction with automated code checking systems.

    Building codes and regulatory standards are becoming increasingly complex
    with the acquisition of new knowledge in the design and construction domain.
    The necessity for computable representation of the building codes and
    regulations for automating the code checking process is becoming ever more
    critical. Within the framework of Building Information Modeling (BIM) work
    process, model checking against building regulations is generally needed to
    be an automatic or semi-automatic process. These checking mechanisms
    generally do not modify a building design, but rather evaluates a design on
    the basis of the configuration of objects, their relations and attributes.
    This paper presents a summary of the core existing methods for computerizing
    building codes and standards. It reviews main concepts for these methods
    including knowledge representation, reasoning procedures, and knowledge
    acquisition. Moreover, this study evaluates the capabilities of the reviewed
    methods in reference to their practical applications and applied limitations
    for modeling computable building codes and standards. Additionally, the
    paper proposes methods with practical flexibility of encoding building codes
    knowledge domain and at the same time possess transparent and verifiable
    syntax and sematic features. The suggested approaches rely on evidently
    identifying objective and subjective data of the regulatory text before
    formalizing building codes. The methodology realizes the limitations of the
    formalization systems by clearly identifying which components of the
    building codes and standards can be transformed into computable model and
    which parts can't be encoded and requires manual compliance checking.

    Building Information Models (BIMs) allow for computationally checking
    whether a building design satisfies all the building codes, requirements,
    etc. if constraints are included in the model. One application for this is
    mass customization in the housing sector, when clients modify the design
    without help from the architect. This paper describes the technical aspects
    of checking constraints on a building model. Specifically, we look at the
    feasibility of checking constraints on an IFC model by creating a prototype
    in which constraints can be entered and checked on an imported IFC model.
    Conclusions are drawn on the suitability of the IFC model and how IFC can be
    extended or adjusted to support constraint checking.

    Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies enable the AEC-FM industry
    to create a shared virtual model of a project. BIM not only includes 3D
    geometry information but also information assigned as parameters to BIM
    elements. However, the information stored in BIM model elements is not
    comprehensive. For example, a chiller manufacturer provides a large volume
    of product data in pdf file format that is not included in the BIM model. It
    is possible to attach PDF files to BIM elements; the problem with an
    attached PDF is that its content cannot be interpreted by a computer.
    Automated retrieval and integration of distributed sources of data requires
    data in a machine-processable format. One way to solve this problem is to
    manually add additional data as element properties to a BIM model. However,
    manually inputting data to BIM platforms (e.g. Autodesk Revit) is a very
    time consuming and error-prone task. In this article, the authors present
    the Semantic Web technology as a new solution to integrating building
    product manufacturers’ data with BIM information. The authors convert both
    BIM data and building product data to RDF/OWL format. Data stored in RDF/OWL
    format can be easily processed by machines and integrated with RDF/OWL
    formatted data from other sources over the Internet. The authors use
    Semantic Web Services to handle data communication between a BIM knowledge
    base and the product manufacturers’ knowledge bases. The authors compare
    manual entry of manufacturer data to a BIM model to the semantics-based data
    integration presented in the paper. Results show that the authors’ approach
    improves productivity.

    A construction project requires collaboration of several organizations such

    Cost estimating is a vital activity for contractors. Cost estimates require
    cost information collected from several sources. These sources include
    material and equipment suppliers. Current estimating software programs
    maintain a large database of resource cost data which must be updated before
    starting new estimates. The process of updating such databases is both time
    consuming and error prone. This paper discusses the architecture of a new
    approach to construction cost estimating using the semantic web technology.
    The semantic web technology structures data according to formal ontologies
    intended to promote machine understanding. Semantic web services provide
    interfaces for publishing information. The proposed estimating approach
    requires that suppliers encapsulate their product information within
    appropriate interfaces and make this information available to contractors
    through web services. Estimating software applications can retrieve the
    latest cost data from suppliers’ web services. The paper discusses how
    ontologies can be used to publish product information and develop
    ontology-based estimating applications. INTRODUCTION A building construction
    project is a collection of work items that produce building elements. To
    estimate the cost of a work item in a project, one needs to know the item
    quantity and the unit costs of the necessary resources. Current estimating
    applications keep a built-in database of resource (material, equipment, and
    labor) costs as shown in Figure 1. Item quantities are digitally extracted
    from a building model. Resource costs continuously change; however, current
    estimating applications do not have the built-in capability to update their
    cost databases. Therefore, estimators must obtain the latest resource costs
    from suppliers and manually update estimating application databases, which
    is a time consuming process.

    Abstract Architecture, engineering, construction and facility management
    (AEC-FM) projects involve a large number of participants that must exchange
    information and combine their knowledge for successful completion of a
    project. Currently, most of the AEC-FM domains store their information about
    a project in text documents or use XML, relational, or object-oriented
    formats that make information integration difficult. The AEC-FM industry is
    not taking advantage of the full potential of the Semantic Web for
    streamlining sharing, connecting, and combining information from different
    domains. The Semantic Web is designed to solve the information integration
    problem by creating a web of structured and connected data that can be
    processed by machines. It allows combining information from different
    sources with different underlying schemas distributed over the Internet. In
    the Semantic Web, all data instances and data schema are stored in a graph
    data store, which makes it easy to merge data from different sources. This
    paper presents a shared ontology approach to semantic representation of
    building information. The semantic representation of building information
    facilitates finding and integrating building information distributed in
    several knowledge bases. A case study demonstrates the development of a
    semantic based building design knowledge base.

    Abstract In response to the growing concerns about climate change and the
    environment, sustainable design of buildings is increasingly demanded by
    building owners and users. However, fast evaluation of various design
    options and identification of the optimized design requires application of
    design analysis tools such as energy modeling, daylight simulations, and
    natural ventilation analysis software. Energy analysis requires access to
    distributed sources of information such as building element material
    properties provided by designers, mechanical equipment information provided
    by equipment manufacturers, weather data provided by weather reporting
    agencies, and energy cost data from energy providers. Gathering energy
    related information from different sources and inputting the information to
    an energy analysis application is a time consuming process. This causes
    delays and increases the time for comparing different design alternatives.
    This paper discusses how Semantic Web technology can facilitate information
    collection from several sources for energy analysis. Semantic Web enables
    sharing, accessing, and combining information over the Internet in a machine
    process-able format. This would free building designers to concentrate on
    building design optimization rather than spending time on data preparation
    and manual entry into energy analysis applications.

    Both planning and design phase of large infrastructural project require
    analysis, modelling, visualization, and numerical analysis. To perform these
    tasks, different tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
    numerical analysis software are commonly employed. However, in current
    engineering practice, there are no systematic solutions for the exchange
    between design and analysis models, and these tasks usually involve manual
    and error-prone model generation, setup and update. In this paper, focussing
    on tunnelling engineering, we demonstrate a systematic and versatile
    approach to efficiently generate a tunnel design and analyse the lining in
    different practical scenarios. To this end, a BIM-based approach is
    developed, which connects a user-friendly industry-standard BIM software
    with effective simulation tools for high-performance computing. A fully
    automatized design-through-analysis workflow solution for segmented tunnel
    lining is developed based on a fully parametric design model and an
    isogeometric analysis software, connected through an interface implemented
    with a Revit plugin.

    This paper explores the foundation of semantic based model checking
    concepts. Development of computable rulesin a pure semantic based concept is
    characterized by “soft coding” by following a pre-defined mark-upmethodology
    for linguistic (text and numbers) analysis, organization, execution and
    reporting. The software programming for this can be done automatically or
    semi-automatically based on predefined procedures. Thisenables a person
    skilled in the AEC domain to develop applicable rules without support of
    programmers. Therules can be then be applied to the semantic content of a
    Building Information Model, typically in the IFC format.Whether it is
    possible to develop a valid and reliable system applicable to rule sources
    (laws, codes, regulationsand standards) depends on testing two key
    hypotheses:The user's perspective is basis for the first hypothesis which
    says that a pre-defined semantic system or toolset can be used by person
    skilled in the AEC domain (not software programmer) to define rules. The
    second hypothesis proposes that a system for automatic, or semi-automatic,
    generation of applicable rule sets for softwareimplementation can be
    developed

    Compliance to regulations, requirements and recommendations remains a weak
    point for the design, construction, and operation in the built environment.
    The RASE mark-up methodology has been demonstrated to significantly raise
    the accuracy and efficiency of the capture and evaluation of regulations and
    requirements. This paper extends the relevance of RASE beyond regulations
    and requirements into two new areas, firstly where uncertainty may impact
    decision making and secondly where design is supported by constraints.
    Examples are taken from UK Building Regulations Approved Documents Part M on

    In both the Geo and BIM domains, it is widely acknowledged that the
    integration of geo-data and BIM-data is beneficial and a crucial step in
    facing the multi-disciplinary challenges of our built environment. The
    result of this integration – broadly termed as GeoBIM – has a range of
    potential uses from district study to road safety. However, from the data
    perspective, this integration raises the question of how to integrate very
    detailed design and construction data from the BIM domain with contextual
    geospatial data (both 2D and 3D) that model a very diverse range of aspects
    of the wider built and natural environment.

    This paper reports work carried out during the second phase of the EuroSDR
    GeoBIM project, which sets out to understand the general status of GeoBIM
    across Europe with particular focus from a National Mapping and Cadastral
    Agency perspective. The first phase of the project reviewed the current
    status of GeoBIM in participating countries and identified the need for
    specific detailed use cases to overcome both the lack of awareness and the
    lack of understanding of the potential of GeoBIM. We present both an update
    on the current status of GeoBIM, and additional details of one of the
    selected use cases relating to planning/development permits. For the latter,
    we have been able to develop a detailed workflow highlighting specific data
    exchange points within the process to issue a development permit, allowing a
    more in-depth identification of both the roles and data needs at each stage.

    Among the digitalization processes which are being raised in Europe and in
    the world, the building permit process is seen as one of the priorities by
    municipalities, governmental institutions and standardization organizations.
    However, in current practice, the building permit issuing as well as the
    integration of geoinformation with BIM (GeoBIM) suffers from a number of
    complex sub-issues. These issues still remain and prevent the development of
    successful methodologies. In this paper, the building permit use case is
    explored within a project in close collaboration with the municipality of
    Rotterdam. A very specific case study in Rotterdam was selected as a
    starting point, which allowed us to develop the needed methodology for the
    implementation of an effective tool. In this paper we highlight the
    interpretation and formalization of regulation for building height, overhang
    and tower ratio. While these rules are specific to a zoning plan in
    Rotterdam, we believe that the methodology and encountered issues in
    formalizing the rules, applying the rules on delivered models and
    integrating various data sources (BIM and GIS specifically) are general to
    most building codes.

    To support building permit issuing with automatic digital tools, the reuse
    of models produced by designers would make the process quicker and more
    objective. However, current studies and pilots often leave a gap with
    respect to the models as actually provided by architects, having varying
    quality and content. In this study, rather than taking a top down approach,
    we started from the available data and made the necessary inferences, which
    gave the opportunity to tackle basic and common issues often preventing
    smooth automatic processing. Specific characteristics of the IFC models were
    outlined and a tool was developed to extract the necessary information from
    them to check representative regulations. While the case study is specific
    in location, regulations and input models, the type of issues encountered
    are a generally applicable example for automated code compliance checking.
    This represents a solid base for future works towards the automation of
    building permits issuing.

    The digitalization of the process for building permit (involving the use of
    3D information systems) is seen as a priority in a wide part of the world.
    Since it is a very multidisciplinary use case, involving a variety of
    stakeholders tackling complex issues and topics, some of them joined their
    efforts and skills in the European Network for Digital Building Permit. The
    initial activity of the network, after a review of on-going experiences, was
    a workshop to share knowledge about the topics involved and to identify the
    main ambitions of the network with respect to three pillars (i.e. Process –
    Rules and Requirements – Technology) and the related requirements. It was
    achieved through a collective brainstorming activity guided by digital
    tools, whose results were further analysed in a post-processing phase. Such
    results are presented in this paper and will be the base for planning the
    future network activity.

    The integration of 3D city models with Building Information Models (BIM),
    coined as GeoBIM, facilitates improved data support to several applications,
    e.g., 3D map updates, building permits issuing, detailed city analysis,
    infrastructure design, context-based building design, to name a few. To
    solve the integration, several issues need to be tackled and solved, i.e.,
    harmonization of features, interoperability, format conversions, integration
    of procedures. The GeoBIM benchmark 2019, funded by ISPRS and EuroSDR,
    evaluated the state of implementation of tools addressing some of those
    issues. In particular, in the part of the benchmark described in this paper,
    the application of georeferencing to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
    models and making consistent conversions between 3D city models and BIM are
    investigated, considering the OGC CityGML and buildingSMART IFC as reference
    standards. In the benchmark, sample datasets in the two reference standards
    were provided. External volunteers were asked to describe and test
    georeferencing procedures for IFC models and conversion tools between
    CityGML and IFC. From the analysis of the delivered answers and processed
    datasets, it was possible to notice that while there are tools and
    procedures available to support georeferencing and data conversion,
    comprehensive definition of the requirements, clear rules to perform such
    two tasks, as well as solid technological solutions implementing them, are
    still lacking in functionalities. Those specific issues can be a sensible
    starting point for planning the next GeoBIM integration agendas.

    Growing interest is awarded to the digitalization of the building permitting
    use case and many works are developed about the topic. However, the subject
    is very complex and many aspects are usually tackled separately, making it
    very hard for traditional literature reviews to grasp the actual progress in
    the overall topic. This paper unveils the detailed state of the art in
    Digital Building Permitting (DBP) by critically analysing the literature by
    means of a set of coding tags (research progress, implementation, affected
    DBP workflow steps, ambitions addressed) assigned by a multidisciplinary
    team. The executed research shows that the mainly addressed aspects of the
    digitalization of building permit process are the technologies to check the
    compliance of design proposals against regulations, followed by the
    digitalization of regulations. Improvable aspects identified in the entire
    building permit system are instead e.g. the involvement of officers,
    scalability of solutions and interoperability of data, intended both as data
    validation and as integration of geospatial data with building models. ©

  abstract: >-
    This presentation describes the use of linked data approaches to permit
    queries across large, diverse information sources to allow reasoning about
    complex questions at multiple geographic scales. The developed methodology
    leverages a central spine model that provides a common hierarchical context;
    various heterogeneous external information sources can be associated with
    these contexts, creating a homogeneous data network that can be queried
    using federated SPARQL queries. These distributed sources are, in
    themselves, registered in a central catalogue in order to facilitate data
    discovery; the actual data, however, remains under the control of their
    source organisations. In this way a large, extensible, interconnected
    network of distributed data describing a built environment can be
    constructed; this network can be queried centrally to provide customised
    views of subsets of the data.. The utility of the architecture is
    demonstrated by establishing a data network to support Ireland's Economic
    and Social Research Institute (ESRI) analysts to investigate the impact of
    various decarbonisation scenarios on the Irish transmission grid. An
    instance of the Dynamic District Information Model (DDIM) server was used
    for this analysis. Large datasets were necessary to support this
    investigation, including details of 220 transmission nodes, c.16,500 small
    areas and approximately 2 million residential buildings. A series of
    residential energy archetypes were developed, including as-is and energy
    consumption per residence archetype for numerous scenarios, including the
    adoption of heat pumps and electric vehicles. It was found that the DDIM
    approach enabled integration of large scale and heterogeneous datasets,
    finer grained data analysis, and improved the accuracy of the analysis.

    The building permission process is to a large extent an analogue process
    where much information is handled in paper format or as pdf files. With the
    ongoing digitalisation in society, there is a potential to automate this
    process by integrating Building Information Models (BIM) of planned
    buildings and geospatial data to check if a building conforms to the
    building permission regulations. In this study, an inventory of which
    regulations in the (Swedish) detailed development plans that can be
    automatically checked or supported by 3D visualisation was conducted. Then,
    two of these regulations, the building height and the building footprint
    area, were studied in detail to find to which extent they can be
    automatically checked by integration of BIM and geospatial data. In
    addition, a feasibility study of one visual criterion was conducted. One
    concern when automating the building permission process is the variability
    of content within the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model.
    Variations in modelling methods and model content leads to differences in
    IFC models&rsquo; content and structure; these differences complicate
    automated processes. To facilitate automated processes, requirements on the
    production of IFC models for building permission applications could be
    defined in the form of model view definitions or delivery specifications.

    The buildingSMARTs BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) is a vendor-neutral
    standard to communicate BIM-based issues. The aspirations are well in line
    with open BIM- and the linked building data (LBD) community to use open data
    standards in Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. Our
    previous research introduced the bcfOWL ontology to express BCF data using
    the open Web of Data standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as
    part of the Linked Building Data (LBD). The current BCF API standard
    expresses changes in the model as event logs that indirectly describe the
    modifications. The focus is on different changes issue descriptions are
    going through in the course of a life cycle of a building. This paper
    presents four different approaches for expressing the temporal changes as
    Linked Data. Two RDF-star approaches and a state construction inspired by
    the Ontology for Property Management (OPM) are introduced. Moreover, we show
    Event System method that is close to the original BCF API. To compare the
    approaches, queries to get the current data and search the history are
    provided on an external repository. Finally, the results and their
    adaptation for LBD, in general, are assessed.

    Abstract The capability to accurately detect changes between successive
    versions of the IFC representation of a BIM model would enable the
    development of generic change management functionalities for construction
    projects. Unfortunately, IFC models consist mostly of anonymous objects
    without stable identities; therefore the computation of differences between
    versions is complicated. When IFC models are converted into an RDF
    representation, the uniform graph structure offers new algorithmic
    opportunities. We study how to assign unique and stable identities to
    anonymous nodes based on signatures generated from their graph environment,
    and present the Short Paths Crossings Algorithm (SPCA) that computes sets of
    paths with limited length from anonymous nodes taking into account their
    crossings. Empirical tests show that SPCA produces significantly smaller
    difference sets for IFC-derived graphs than previous algorithms for RDF
    change detection.

    This paper aims to describe the definition of KBimCode Language and to
    demonstrate its actual use case. KBimCode is a domain-specific computer
    language to represent the regulatory sentences in the Korea Building Act as
    explicit computable rules currently focusing on the building permit-related
    requirements. As other domain-specific languages are usually in pursuit of
    both ease-of-use and adequate fidelity to deal with complex domain-specific
    issues, KBimCode also aims to accomplish a neutral and standardized way of
    rule-making in an easy-to-use syntax. To address how KBimCode has achieved
    such objectives, the following main topics are covered in this paper: 1)
    Language design: features of the Korea Building Act are reflected in a
    strategy for lexical and syntactic design of KBimcode Language; 2) Language
    definition: based on the context-free EBNF notation, specifications of
    KBimCode Language are described; 3) Demonstration: KBimCode can be applied
    to a BIM assessment tool and executed for rule checking. The examples
    presented in this paper describe the series of the process. KBimCode is one
    of the outcomes of an ongoing research project to develop automated design
    review systems for building permits in Korea.

    As building information modeling (BIM) is expanding its influence in various
    fields of architecture, engineering, construction and facility management
    (AEC-FM) industry, BIM-based automated code compliance checking has become
    possible prospects. For the automated code compliance checking, requirements
    in building code need to be processed into explicit representation that
    enables automated reasoning. This paper aims to develop high-level methods
    that translate verb phrases into explicit representation. The high-level
    methods represent conditions, properties, and related actions of the
    building objects and clarify the core content of the constraints. The
    authors analyze building permit requirements in Korea Building Code and
    establish a standardized process of deriving the high-level methods. As a
    result, 60 kinds of the high-level methods were derived. In addition, method
    classification, analysis, and application are introduced. This study will
    contribute to the representation of explicit building code sentences and
    establishment of the automated building permit system of Korea.

    This paper aims to describe applications of KBimCode that enables
    representation, definition and evaluation of building permit rules for
    BIM-enabled code compliance checking. KBimCode is a standardized script
    language. It is developed to represent the Korean Building Act as explicit
    computable rules. The application of KBimCode can be summarized as: 1)
    Preparation of natural language rule, 2) representation of rule, 3)
    definition of rule, 4) execution of rule, and 5) execution result and
    report. This paper mainly focuses on describing the process and mechanism of
    each stage of KBimCode application. First, natural language rules are
    translated into KBimCode through logic rule-based mechanism. KBimCode are
    generated and managed by logic rule-based system called KBimLogic. Second,
    we introduce a design strategy and definition of KBimCode syntax.
    Application of KBimCode database is also handled. Third, execution of
    KBimCode is demonstrated with BIM assessment software and its result is
    reported. For the demonstration presented in this paper, Korean Building Act
    sentences were translated into KBimCode series and evaluated in a BIM
    assessment tool named KbimAssess-lite. KBimCode is an ongoing project and
    will contribute to establish automated design quality assessment system for
    building permit in Korea.

    This paper aims to describe rule checking method, classification and its
    demonstration. As applications of BIM extends, there have been some
    challenging projects on automated building compliance checking. The current
    rule-making method is developercentered and thus is difficult to define
    rules without propound programming knowledge. This paper introduces high
    level rule making methods with law sentence-centered approach. The proposed
    methods have intuitive naming convention and are directly mapped with the
    predicate of the law sentences. Therefore, it is easy to infer function of
    the methods. According to the type of object and property in instance level,
    three hierarchies of method classification were set: 1) level 1 divides
    types of instance, 2) level 2 classifies the type of property, and 3) level
    3 specifies the content of checking. From the level 3, representative rule
    checking method is defined. The representative method is subdivided into
    extended methods according to the specific object and property to check. The
    rule checking methods are combined together to form an intermediate
    pseudocode. The pseudo-code is later to be parsed into computer executable
    form. This paper mainly focuses on 1) introducing law sentence -centered
    rule checking method, 2) object and property-based classification of rule
    checking method, 3) method extensibility and 4) demonstration of rule
    checking methods with actual requirement sentences from the Korea Building
    Permit. The high level rule checking method is developed as a part of
    KBimLogic. KBimLogic is a software that translates the Korea Building Permit
    requirement into computer executable format. KBimLogic is now under
    development with government funding.

    Accurate and valid data is essential during the development of building
    projects and throughout the use phase of buildings. This study proposes a
    framework to help owners and facility managers in: (a) defining the
    requirements for asset management tasks in a structured way; (b) validating
    project and asset data against the established requirements; and (c)
    visualising asset data, stored in different and distributed sources, in an
    integrated and interactive way to support specific asset/facility management
    functions (e.g. maintenance tasks). The framework combines the use of
    Information Delivery Manual (IDM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC),
    Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie), and Content
    Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) in the development of Asset
    Information Models (AIM) to fulfil the owner’s requirements (Asset
    Information Requirements) throughout the lifecycle of a building. An AIM is
    a data model that contains all digital data (graphical, non-graphical, and
    documentary) required to operate an asset or portfolio of assets. Validation
    methods are identified for each of the AIM data types and a method for their
    integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual
    environment.

    The proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the
    validation of the various data sources against the client requirements,
    defined in the Asset Information Requirement (AIR); and (2) the
    visualisation of asset data required for a maintenance task in an
    interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the
    capability of the framework to enable the definition of AIR and the
    validation of the different AIM’s data deliverables. The visualisation of
    the AIM data - from different and distributed sources - for a maintenance
    task was successfully performed in an integrated and interactive game
    environment. Future work will consider other data sources and will evaluate
    the proposed framework using real industrial data.

    BIM-based tools can contribute to addressing some of the challenges faced by
    structural engineering practitioners. A BIM-based framework for the
    development of components that deliver Automatic Code Compliance (ACC) is
    presented. The structural design problems that such components solve are
    categorised as simple, where ACC can be implemented directly, or complex,
    where more advanced approaches are needed. The mathematical process of
    Multi-Dimensional Data Fitting (MDDF) is introduced in order for the latter,
    enabling the compression of complex engineering calculations to a single
    equation that can be easily implemented into a BIM software engineering
    package. Proof-of-concept examples are given for both cases:
    offsite-manufactured structural joists are utilised as a non-recursive
    example, implementing the results obtained in the manufacturer’s literature;
    the axial capacity of metal fasteners in axially loaded timber-to-timber
    connections are utilised as an example of recursive problems. The MDDF
    analysis and its implementation in a BIM package of those problems are
    presented. Finally, the concept is generalised for non-structural aspects at
    a framework level, and the challenges, implications, and prospects of ACC in
    a BIM context are discussed.

    Building service systems are complex structures consisting of different
    subsystems and components in varying relationships. Semantic Web
    Technologies (SWT) can be used to represent these systems in decentralized
    triplestores using ontologies. To describe interconnected building service
    systems and the flow of matter, energy and data between them over the whole
    life-cycle in the context of the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and
    Operation (AECO) industry, two recent contributions, TUBES System Ontology
    (TSO) and Flow System Ontology (FSO) have to be considered. This study thus
    supports the effort towards a future semantic web of building data by
    validating the given ontologies based on Competency Questions (CQs) and an
    application example, proposing an alignment of TSO v0.3.0 and FSO v0.1.0 and
    providing a roadmap to a unified representation of building service systems
    in the AECO industry.

    Building service systems are complex structures with varying relationships
    between different components. In the design, planning, construction,
    commissioning and operation of these systems, many stakeholders with
    different interests and information needs have to work together, which
    further increases the overall complexity. Building Information Modeling
    (BIM) was introduced to enhance the interoperability providing a
    machine-readable representation consisting of semantical, geometrical and
    alphanumerical information. Semantic web technologies enable further
    improvement of the interoperability by linking information on data level
    using a global unique identification key in a web-based decentralized data
    store. To contribute to these developments, a brief literature review
    covering representations of building service systems such as IfcOWL, BRICK,
    SAREF and a comparison of their scopes and core concepts is given. Based on
    these findings, recent developments regarding the TUBES system ontology
    (TSO) and their alignment to the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) are
    presented. TSO strives to represent interconnected building service systems
    and their exchange of energy, mass and data on different levels of
    granularity based on the general system theory. The ontology is validated
    using a real-life project.

    Abstract An increasing number of information management and information
    exchange applications in construction industry is relying on semantic web
    technologies or tools from the Linked Open Data (LOD) domain to support data
    interoperability, flexible data exchange, distributed data management and
    the development of reusable tools. These goals tend to be overlapped with
    the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard
    for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A
    connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard
    would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for
    IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established
    IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of
    semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of
    the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose
    software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and
    knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing
    efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and
    analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable
    ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of
    an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL
    ontology.

    time-series databases that store sensor data values (big data; data lakes);
    diverse standard file formats to represent 2D and 3D geometry; and property
    servers as well as product databases. This chapter will particularly
    investigate knowledge graphs and linked data. These data technologies
    promise to represent any data on the web and link them all together. This
    chapter will explain the most basic parts of the technology, while omitting
    technical detail. It gives an overview of how these technologies are used in
    the AEC and smart buildings domains. The chapter ends with a discussion on
    applicability and limitations of the documented technologies and an outlook
    into the future.

    The Special Issue of Automation in Construction is about why and how to use
    the Web of Data technologies (RDF, OWL) for building information management
    (BIM). The article by Radulovic and colleagues, Guidelines for Linked Data
    Generation and Publication: an Example in Building Energy Consumption,
    focuses on making a set of guidelines available regarding the proper
    generation and publication of linked data, aiming specifically at the
    context of energy consumption in buildings. The article by Terkaj and Sojic,
    Ontology-based Representation of IFC EXPRESS rules: an enhancement of the
    ifcOWL ontology, gives a detailed indication of how the recent actions
    towards the development of an OWL version of the IFC schema can be extended
    to consider IFC EXPRESS rules. Costa and Madrazo combine both types of
    information in their article, named Connecting building component catalogues
    with BIM models using semantic technologies: an application case for precast
    concrete components, aiming to assist the design team in the assembly and
    dimensioning of structural components during the project phase. The third
    article included in this Special Issue is presented by Corry and colleagues,
    entitled, A performance assessment ontology for the environmental and energy
    management of buildings. In this article, an investigation is made of the
    ways in which semantic web technologies can be used to combine all sorts of
    energy-related data in buildings, so that the performance gap between
    measured and simulated energy performance level of a building can be made to
    increase.

    Today's construction industry relies heavily on high-performing building
    information modelling (BIM) systems. By deploying the Industry Foundation
    Classes (IFC) as a description language, these systems offer building
    information in a widely interoperable format, so that several applications
    are able to infer extra information. For a certain functionality, IFC shows
    limitations however. Existing semantic web technology may be able to
    overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant
    improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and
    construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC
    as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the
    semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web
    languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation
    approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building
    design and construction. An implemented test case for acoustic performance
    checking illustrates the improvements of such an environment compared to
    traditionally deployed approaches in rule checking.

    As more and more architectural design and construction data is represented
    in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model, it makes sense to
    take advantage of the underlying logical basis of RDF and realise a semantic
    rule-checking process as it is currently not available in architectural
    design and construction industry. Such a semantic rule-checking process
    would be of considerable value to regulation compliance checking procedures,
    because the additional logical basis would (1) allow consistency checking of
    the rules in the regulations (and thus a better management of the rules),
    (2) allow a faster, more transparent and more reliable implementation of
    regulation compliance checking procedures (rules are human-readable and more
    easily changeable), and (3) provide the option to rely on available
    reasoning engines and generate proofs without any additional implementation
    effort. Obviously, there are a number of strategies and approaches that can
    be followed regarding the realisation of such a rule-checking process. In
    this article, we will outline a number of rule-checking approaches that have
    been reported for semantic rule-checking in the AEC domain, including
    rule-based checking algorithms implemented on BIM platforms as plug-ins,
    Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rule based checking relying on an external
    rule engine, and N3Logic-based rule checking using a backward-chaining
    procedure. For every approach, a number of implementation procedures will be
    considered. This will result in a comprehensive strategic overview at the
    end of the paper, which can be used as a guide for parties interested in
    implementing a semantic rule-checking process for regulation compliance
    checking.

    Abstract Over the recent years, the usage of semantic web technologies has
    notably increased in the domains of architecture, engineering and
    construction (AEC). These technologies are typically considered as
    complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling
    (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is
    thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue
    among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve
    information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains
    of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable
    resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the AEC
    domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these
    technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an
    extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the
    development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC
    domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These
    examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve
    as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of
    semantic web technologies in the AEC domains. Results show that semantic web
    technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and
    applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g.
    BIM + Infra + GIS + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard
    work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation
    and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2)
    devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate
    combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic
    and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures.

    The interoperability challenge is a long-standing challenge in the domain of
    architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Diverse approaches have
    already been presented for addressing this challenge. This article will look
    into the possibility of addressing the interoperability challenge in the
    building life-cycle with a linked data approach. An outline is given of how
    linked data technologies tend to be deployed, thereby working towards a
    “more holistic” perspective on the building, or towards a large-scale web of
    “linked building data”. From this overview, and the associated use case
    scenarios, we conclude that the interoperability challenge cannot be
    “solved” using linked data technologies, but that it can be addressed. In
    other words, information exchange and management can be improved, but a
    pragmatic usage of technologies is still required in practice. Finally, we
    give an initial outline of some anticipated use cases in the building
    life-cycle in which the usage of linked data technologies may generate
    advantages over existing technologies and methods.

    There can be no doubt of the impact emerging and innovative technology is
    making across the entire construction industry. From planning, design,
    construction, and facilities or asset management, these latest “tools” are
    becoming the norm. These technologies are also becoming more prevalent in
    the infrastructure and transportation industries. There are challenges to
    consider when adopting new software or hardware solutions, in which people
    can be the biggest hurdle. Business owners must be convinced the ROI is
    there and users must see that the learning curve is not so disruptive that
    it impacts the project schedule. There can also be reluctance to embrace
    technology designed to address a process that has “always been done that
    way.” Nearly everyone agrees that IT makes sense and it is inevitable in the
    coming years. The questions that need to be addressed are what to adopt and
    how to do it remain the primary concerns? With examples from the
    transportation industry, this paper discusses the latest practices,
    challenges, practical solutions, and the outlook of information technology
    and data integration in the construction, infrastructure, and transportation

    The fourth industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, is transforming
    decision-making through the increasing use of information and digitization
    technologies. While Industry 4.0 is expanding rapidly in manufacturing
    industries, its induced transformations are gradually affecting other
    sectors, including the construction industry. In recent years, the use of
    4.0 technologies in the construction industry, termed as ‘Construction 4.0’,
    has increased, mostly due to the immense potential of Industry 4.0 for
    improving the performance of construction projects and structuring their
    underlying management processes. This paper proposes a classification of
    existing literature on applications of Construction 4.0 technologies to
    allow for a better analysis of trends and gaps in the research. A total of
    nearly 200 research papers between 2009 and 2020 were reviewed and analyzed.
    Overall, the analysis shows that research on Construction 4.0 is closely
    aligned with the construction phase. Also, the most researched topics seem
    to be related to the management processes of quality, risk, and health and
    safety.

    The advancements in Building Information Modelling, Building Monitoring
    Systems and machine learning have made the discovery of hidden insights and
    performance patterns in operational building data possible and highly
    accurate. Semantic web technologies play a fundamental role in terms of
    knowledge representation and provide the necessary infrastructure for reuse
    of the discovered insights. Such knowledge can be of particular importance
    to decision-making for building performance improvement, however, this
    requires patterns discovered with traditional data mining techniques to be
    attributed with semantics, so that they can be machine-interpretable and
    reusable. Using linked data-based crowdsourcing techniques for
    interpretation of building performance patterns enables the creation of
    knowledge graphs of building data, enriched with contextualized building
    performance insights. This paper presents a crowdsourcing mechanism that
    allows the semantic enrichment of building performance patterns through
    semantic annotation and classification. We discuss the results and the
    potential of linked building data graphs enriched with building performance
    insights.

    The report investigates the current state of classification for the built
    infrastructure environment, while acknowledging that present tools and
    systems need to recognise the rapid move towards a full digital description
    of assets and there their functions. It examines criteria for transition and
    future classification systems. In addition the report looks towards fully
    information modelled outputs and linked information, which create a ‘Smart
    Infrastructure’ world.


    Summary of conclusions drawn in this report: 

    - Classification allows us to understand and identify object types and the
    properties associated with them.

    - There are a number of critical criteria that should characterise choice of
    classification tools identified and laid out in the report.

    - Most current classification systems are still evolving and developing and
    hence do not meet all future and present requirements. All require further
    development to fill the current gaps in their implementation.in

    - There is a danger of trying to force fit BIM requirements into
    classification systems that were designed for the analogue era rather than
    evolving them for the digital engineering future.

    - The industry is in a transition phase moving from analogue information
    capture and distribution to a fully digital one.

    - The tools we chose during this migration phase must support both but lead
    us towards fully digital as soon as possible.

    - There is no specific Classification system that can be recommended however
    the features and aims of CCS & CoClass which combine the requirements of
    current facet and enumerated standards plus uses reference designation
    approach defining relationships and aims culminate in asset delivery comes
    closest to meeting the criteria. However, it is recognised that there are
    some issues relating to the use of function as a main sub-divider which need
    to be resolved.

    - Although classification is often used to generate intelligent name labels
    for objects and features in CAD and BIM Models this should be regarded as a
    transitionary process used whilst users still rely on design current design
    tools.

    - The question of the difference between a Project Information Model (PIM)
    and an asset Information Model (AIM) is redundant.  Information about an
    asset is created at the start of a project and evolves through the life
    cycle, which includes planning and delivery projects to become the complete
    asset information. In other words, information through life cycle is
    progressive. The only difference would be the during the design and
    construction stages contractual and progress information would be attached
    to the asset under development.

    - A rigid hierarchical view of classification should be avoided in future
    classification but rather a more recursive hierarchy be adopted.

    - There should be an effort to simplify classification.

    - Future digital engineering should look to identifying an object type,
    instantiating it with a unique reference and linking it to properties that
    define that instantiated object rather than cross referring to multiple
    complex tables. In other words, simplifying identity rather than adding
    complexity by including in a string of constructs from many tables.

    - The use of object types with related properties associated with
    classification has potential to simplify what has become a very complex
    subject.

    - The existing systems have much information that could be used as a basis
    to build object type libraries.

    - It is suggested that development of Nordic Object Type Libraries would
    bring together many of the current disparate approaches.

    - Whilst the object type library and semantically linked information
    approach to identifying and relating information is in its relative infancy
    there is little doubt that it provides a good solution to the industry’s
    needs in the medium to long term.

    - Although the industry is not yet fully prepared for a linked data approach
    we should endeavour to prepare for it by incorporating it into our standards
    and make it our direction of travel.

    The built environment has been digitizing rapidly and is now transforming
    into a physical world that is at all times supplemented by a fully
    web-supported and interconnected digital version, often referred to as
    Digital Twin. This book shows how diverse data models and web technologies
    can be created and used for the built environment. Key features of this book
    are its technical nature and technical detail. The first part of the book
    highlights a large diversity of IT techniques and their use in the AEC
    domain, from JSON to XML to EXPRESS to RDF/OWL, for modelling geometry,
    products, properties, sensor and energy data. The second part of the book
    focuses on diverse software solutions and approaches, including digital
    twins, federated data storage on the web, IoT, cloud computing, and smart
    cities. Key research and strategic development opportunities are
    comprehensively discussed for distributed web-based building data
    management, IoT integration and cloud computing. This book aims to serve as
    a guide and reference for experts and professionals in AEC computing and
    digital construction including Master's students, PhD researchers, and
    junior to senior IT-oriented AEC professionals.

    This contribution presents a comprehensive summary of the first phase of the
    research project SEMERGY, aimed towards exploring the potential of Semantic
    Web Technologies to accommodate and support building performance assessment
    and optimization. Previous research on the adoption of performance
    assessment tools by the design community suggested that the extensive amount
    of time, effort and expertise required to accumulate and provide input
    information for various performance evaluations, limits the application of
    such tools for improvement of building design in early stages. Even the most
    rudimentary performance inquiries require large quantities of data regarding
    the properties of incorporated building materials and systems, climatic
    conditions, building codes, etc. Much of this data is available on the
    internet, yet its use is severely hampered by lack of appropriate structure
    and format. The SEMERGY research and development project was conceived with
    the aim of acquiring and utilizing the abundant, yet ill-structured
    building-related data available on the World Wide Web, through
    implementation of Semantic Web Technologies. This web-based data is utilized
    within a flexible, multi-objective design optimization environment,
    incorporating various performance assessment applications. The present
    contribution describes some of the major challenges of the project,
    discusses the adopted approaches, and presents SEMERGY's main features.

    Encouraged by the European Union, all European countries need to enforce
    solutions to reduce non-renewable energy consumption in buildings. The
    reduction of energy (heating, domestic hot water, and appliances
    consumption) aims for the vision of near-zero energy consumption as a
    requirement goal for constructing buildings. In this paper, we review the
    available standards, tools and frameworks on the energy performance of
    buildings. Additionally, this work investigates if energy performance
    ratings can be obtained with energy consumption data from IoT devices and if
    the floor size and energy consumption values are enough to determine a
    dwellings’ energy performance rating. The essential outcome of this work is
    a data-driven prediction tool for energy performance labels that can run
    automatically. The tool is based on the cutting edge kNN classification
    algorithm and trained on open datasets with actual building data such as
    those coming from the IoT paradigm. Additionally, it assesses the results of
    the prediction by analysing its accuracy values. Furthermore, an approach to
    semantic annotations for energy performance certification data with
    currently available ontologies is presented. Use cases for an extension of
    this work are also discussed in the end.

    As semantic web technologies and linked data techniques are of increasing
    importance for the domain of architecture, engineering and construction
    (AEC), also the ontologies that are used by these technologies gain in
    importance and relevance. An ontology is generally defined as “a formal,
    explicit specification of a shared conceptualization”, after Studer et al.
    [1]. Because not only people, but also technologies rely on these
    ontologies, it is important that they are well conceived and well developed.
    In this tutorial session, we will therefore give an overview of the main
    principles behind ontological engineering. We will hereby rely on the
    principles that are developed as part of the NeOn methodology for ontology
    engineering [2]. A schema of this methodology is provided in Figure 1.

    One of the most important issues during the planning of a construction
    project is to maintain the quality of the design planning constantly at a
    high level. Therefore this quality must be checked continuously in terms of
    accuracy and compliance to the applicable codes and guidelines throughout
    the duration of a project. Nowadays this checking process is laborious,
    cumbersome and error-prone since it is mostly performed manually based on
    two-dimensional planning and iteratively at each planning change by the
    responsible planning consultant. Recently, various approaches attempted to
    automate this highly relevant process with the help of digital methods, such
    as Building Information Modeling, in order to reduce the amount of work and
    increase the quality of the planning at the same time. Although this
    Automated Code Compliance Checking has been implemented using a variety of
    different methods, most of the existing approaches fail because they
    represent the information of rules in an insufficient or overly complex
    manner. In this paper a short analysis of the pros and cons of selected
    existing approaches is given and subsequently minimal requirements for a
    successful automation of this process are defined. To counteract the lacks
    and insufficiencies of existing approaches, a new method is introduced which
    enables an automation using a flow-based, visual programming language, which
    we call Visual Code Checking Language (VCCL). Finally the practical
    implementation of a semi-automated compliance check concerning an exemplary
    German fire code demonstrates the viability of the approach.

    In the construction industry, a large number of codes and guidelines define
    technical specifications and standardized requirements to ensure a
    building’s structural stability, accessibility, and energy efficiency, among
    others. Today, checking the compliance with the applicable guidelines is an
    iterative, manual process which is based to a large extent on 2D drawings.
    In consequence, this process is cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone.
    With the increasing adoption of digital methods in the construction
    industry, most importantly Building Information Modeling (BIM), new
    technologies are available to improve and partially automate this process.
    In a BIM-based construction project, digital models that include 3D
    geometric as well as semantic information comprehensively describe the
    building to be erected across the different involved disciplines. This rich
    information provides an excellent basis for automating the code compliance
    checking process. With Automated Code Compliance Checking, not only a higher
    degree of compliance with the different regulations can be achieved, but
    also a significant reduction of effort is possible. The chapter first
    discusses the major challenges of Automated Code Compliance Checking.
    Subsequently, representative available software solutions are presented and
    current research activities are discussed. Finally, an outlook for the
    development of code compliance checking in the construction industry is
    given.

    In the AEC industry, there is a large number of standards and codes which
    ensure the structural stability, reliability, usability of the building
    under design. Accordingly, checking the conformity of the building design
    with these requirements is a crucial process. Nowadays this checking is
    performed to a large extent manually based on two-dimensional technical
    drawings and textual documents. Due to the low level of automation, the
    conventional checking procedure is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone. As
    Building Information Modeling (BIM) becomes more and more mature, a suitable
    digital information basis also becomes available to enable automating the
    process. The commercial solutions for code compliance checking available so
    far mainly follow a black-box approach where the rules that make up a
    certain regulation are implemented in a hard-wired fashion rendering their
    implementation in-transparent and non-extendable. A number of researchers
    have tackled this problem and have proposed various ways that allow the user
    to define rules, either in a standard programming language or in a dedicated
    language. However, AEC domain experts usually do not have the required
    programming skills to use these languages appropriately. To overcome this
    issue, we introduce the Visual Code Checking Language (VCCL), which uses a
    graphical notation in order to represent the rules of a code in a machine-
    and human-readable language. The paper presents the features and
    functionalities of the VCCL in detail and shows its application in a number
    of case studies.

    The first chapter of the report provides an overview of the current
    situation in the use of the Register of Buildings from the perspective of
    the local governments, approving government agencies, network operators and
    construction-related companies. The review outlines a description of the
    situation in the form of descriptions of process mapping and process
    completion practices, as well as data flow mapping and conceptual data view.
    The existing problems, good practices, and suggestions by users are
    described to improve the procedures of the Register of Buildings as a tool
    or the services of procedures supported by it, which is advisable to take
    into account by the register’s owner in the organization of further
    developments. The second chapter of the report describes the vision of what
    kind of tool could be the procedural system of the Register of Buildings be
    in the future. The vision for the future describes the steps to be
    digitalized, including an alternative process flow as an innovation for
    applying for notifications and permits using an information model that would
    allow faster course of the process. In addition, future vision processes,
    data flows, and conceptual data views are described. As an addition,
    complementing requirements for the product development have been described
    which further convey the requirements that have become apparent during the
    work, the conveying of which was not practical with the final prototype or
    the aforementioned descriptions. In order to simplify future procedures,
    checklists were prepared for the case handlers in cooperation with the
    competent authorities, which is an internal tool for the Register of
    Buildings in carrying out future procedures. The suggested practices and
    measures that the case handlers could apply to carry out procedures to
    ensure a more efficient procedure were also described.

    The third chapter of the report carries out an impact analysis as a
    qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the impact of the
    implementation of the future vision (including the new EHR user interface,
    new processes, and compliance with best practices described) on the case
    handlers and other competent authorities.

    The analysis found that, if the procedural volumes of the year 2018 are
    taken as the basis, the implementation of the future vision saves working
    time for the competent authorities in the amount of at least 45 FTEs per
    calendar year.

    The presented work discusses the potential application of ontologies for
    design automation in the building automation field. It relates to an ongoing
    implementation and related prototype being developed by an automation
    systems provider. Modern buildings have complex technical equipment which is
    hard to operate efficiently from a user’s point of view. Optimal
    commissioning and operation of building energy systems necessitate complex
    design and configuration of building automation and control systems (BACS).
    Generally, a BACS supplier or installer uses its own software system and
    customized monitoring databases. The presented approach tries to automate
    BACS setup relying on semantic modeling and knowledge reuse. It shall
    support the design and configuration of complex BACS systems by the means of
    automated characterization of the underlying building energy system and
    inferring of its most adapted control systems and strategies. For that
    purpose, it makes use of ontologies for modeling the topology of energy
    systems as well as emulating the knowledge of BACS design experts. Indeed,
    automation providers have much expert knowledge and experience in the
    design, evaluation and commissioning of energy system controls. It is
    investigated whether this manufacturer expertise can be represented via
    knowledge representation and model parameterization. A workflow is proposed
    that shall make it possible to support automated BACS design relying on a
    formalized description of HVAC systems from a wide variety of application
    fields using a generic templates library. For this purpose, existing energy
    systems are examined with regard to various structural properties such as
    topology, energy flows and control loop structures as well as needed sensors
    and monitoring functions. It is taken into account that the energy supply of
    buildings is planned individually to a high level of detail due to different
    system requirements. Therefore, an automated design of control systems
    requires the limitation and classification of possible system
    configurations. Knowledge about control concepts and controller
    architectures of distributed energy systems is required for the automatic
    generation of control architectures. This knowledge must be collected,
    systematized and stored appropriately. At the beginning, relevant controller
    concepts and controller architectures for the application in the targeted
    energy system are selected and described. A component library contains
    models for controllers and energy system components as well as buildings and
    plant models. For this purpose, it is necessary to create tools that allow
    the semi-automatic generation and testing of such components from the
    library. A prototype is being implemented inside design software of IFM
    automation solutions provider in cooperation with Fraunhofer.

    "Ontology-based Building Energy System Commissioning and Monitoring":
    Commissioning and operating building energy systems necessitates much
    configuration and testing work of the building monitoring and automation
    system. Generally suppliers and installers use singular proprietary software
    systems and customized monitoring databases. Once setup and in operation,
    there is also no guarantee that the building is energy-efficient and most of
    time building users themselves act as energy wasting factors due to their
    wrong usage of the building energy system. As a response, the presented work
    aims at developing an expert system that shall ease the transition between
    design and operation as well as provide live recommendations for a
    continuous commissioning of the building energy system. For that purpose, it
    relies on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web technologies.
    The presented approach tries then to bring a complementary added value to
    classical building automation and control systems (BACS) by the means of
    semantic modeling and knowledge reuse for semantic analysis and
    characterization of the building energy system and its operational
    conditions. For that purpose, it implements a knowledge base of energy
    conservation measures and potential operating errors that prescribe
    energy-efficiency actions and handlings to building users or a facility
    managers. The system consumes for a part building data gathered during its
    operation through a monitoring system. For another part, it relies on
    metadata contained in initial BIM-compliant building design models. The
    resulting software application might be used in the future as an add-on to
    existing building management systems (BMS). Modern BMS are able to handle a
    huge amount of data that are analyzed for supervising, controlling and
    benchmarking buildings. BMS data are mainly gained through sensors and
    meters that provide information about e.g. the operational state of
    technical equipment, indoor temperature or energy consumption. Because of
    its highly time-dependent nature, this kind of information can be
    categorized as dynamic data about a building in contrast to static data
    which represent the building and its technical systems as they are i.e. as
    built physical entities. This latter kind of information encompasses data
    about the energy system components, their technical characteristics and
    their layout in the building. Even if numerous dynamic data are produced
    during building operation there is no much use of building static
    information created during its design. In view of that, the proposed
    methodology aims at closing this informational gaps between building design
    and operation by making reuse of initial design models serialized in IFC.
    The intrinsic relationships between dynamic and static data are then
    represented into some ontologies and analyzed by means of logical reasoning.
    In existing BMS those relationships are semantically poor and only contained
    partially in the backend data model of the BMS, like a relational database
    in most cases. The proposed semantic building information model is then used
    for interpreting building energy system behaviors and identifying best
    energy conservation measures. More specifically, an energy system ontology
    together with a risk ontology are introduced to support reuse of knowledge
    for optimized building operation.

    Abstract In the last decade, the paradigm Historical Building Information
    Modeling (HBIM) was investigated to exploit the possibilities offered by the
    application of BIM to historical buildings. In the Cultural Heritage domain,
    the BIM-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector
    populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to
    various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural
    information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of
    a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could
    represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the
    historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel
    approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a
    workflow that exploits the advantages of BIM platforms and Semantic-Web
    technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of
    semantically structured and rich HBIM data. The presented pipeline follows
    four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with
    the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data
    structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and,
    later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment
    was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the
    properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a
    machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the
    domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this
    step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model,
    providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our
    workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application
    based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both
    structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is
    possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with
    appropriate LOD and Grade in BIM environment and then guarantee a complete
    interoperability with IFC/RDF format. Relying on semantically structured
    data (ontologies) and on the Linked Data stack appears a valid approach for
    addressing existing information system issues in the CH domain and
    constitutes a step forward in the management of repositories and web
    libraries devoted to historical buildings.

    Linked Data is the key paradigm of the Semantic Web, a new generation of the
    World Wide Web that promises to bring meaning (semantics) to data. A large
    number of both public and private organizations have published their data
    following the Linked Data principles, or have done so with data from other
    organizations. To this extent, since the generation and publication of
    Linked Data are intensive engineering processes that require high attention
    in order to achieve high quality, and since experience has shown that
    existing general guidelines are not always sufficient to be applied to every
    domain, this paper presents a set of guidelines for generating and
    publishing Linked Data in the context of energy consumption in buildings
    (one aspect of Building Information Models). These guidelines offer a
    comprehensive description of the tasks to perform, including a list of
    steps, tools that help in achieving the task, various alternatives for
    performing the task, and best practices and recommendations. Furthermore,
    this paper presents a complete example on the generation and publication of
    Linked Data about energy consumption in buildings, following the presented
    guidelines, in which the energy consumption data of council sites (e.g.,
    buildings and lights) belonging to the Leeds City Council jurisdiction have
    been generated and published as Linked Data.

    Building automation (BA) systems ensure comfort and safety of the occupants
    while optimizing energy consumption. Malfunctions of electro-mechanical
    equipment or the associated control function result not only in incorrect
    operation, but also wastage of energy. Automated fault detection and
    diagnostics (AFDD) of processes like heating, ventilation, and
    air-conditioning (HVAC) is a challenging task due to the diversity of the
    applications and inter-dependencies between the equipment. Semantic
    description of the building and its equipment can help AFDD agents to better
    understand the system and continuously examine its operation. However, AFDD
    using only the structural description of the building topology and the
    contained equipment without relating it to the control functions requires
    manual verification of the root cause. In this work, we added a model of the
    control functionality to the semantic information of the structural and
    topological description and represented it using W3C Web of Things Thing
    Descriptions. Based on these descriptions, we have demonstrated in a case
    study of a building installation that fault detection rules which have
    access to the semantic description of underlying control functions can be
    formulated more precisely and thereby avoid false positives.

  abstract: >-
    Automation of equipment in a building is essential to achieve reliable and
    energy-efficient operation. The devices used in Building Automation (BA)
    systems have different functional and non-functional requirements, and this
    leads to a heterogeneous system with vertical silos where multiple standards
    are at play along with vendor-specific information models and
    implementations. In such a situation establishing technical and semantic
    interoperability is challenging. Also, the absence of a method to uniformly
    represent entities across verticals and functional layers in BA, makes it
    difficult to link them to knowledge graphs that describe the building and
    its physical processes. The W3C Web of Things (WoT) aims to address this
    (and related) issues in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Based on our
    experience with a real-life implementation in the industry, we demonstrate
    how the challenge of creating uniform interface descriptions for the vast
    and heterogeneous BA standards landscape can be be overcome using WoT Thing
    Descriptions (TDs), and further, we show how such TDs can be linked to
    knowledge graphs by facilitating their integration in the engineering
    workflow. As a concrete use case, our demo shows how an automated fault
    detection system which we developed for room automation controls uses the
    TDs to reason about the physical process and its control programs and then
    retrieves process data for its analysis.

    Building automation (BA) systems orchestrate and monitor the functioning of
    a wide variety of utilities in a building so that living spaces are kept
    comfortable, safe, and secure. The complexity of such a system which
    involves multiple disciplines (heating, air-conditioning, lighting, fire
    safety, security etc.), coming from multiple vendors, is compounded by the
    fact that each building differs in the way the equipment operate and
    coordinate.

    Actors in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner and Operation
    (AECOO) industry traditionally exchange building models as files. The
    Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology advocates the seamless
    exchange of all information between related stakeholders using digital
    technologies. The ultimate evolution of the methodology, BIM Maturity Level
    3, envisions interoperable, distributed, web-based, interdisciplinary
    information exchange among stakeholders across the life-cycle of buildings.
    The World Wide Web Consortium Linked Building Data Community Group (W3C
    LBD-CG) hypothesises that the Linked Data models and best practices can be
    leveraged to achieve this vision in modern web-based applications. In this
    paper, we introduce the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) as a core
    vocabulary to this approach. It provides a high-level description of the
    topology of buildings including storeys and spaces, the building elements
    they contain, and their web-friendly 3D models. We describe how existing
    applications produce and consume datasets combining BOT with other
    ontologies that describe product catalogues, sensor observations, or
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices effectively implementing BIM Maturity Level
    3. We evaluate our approach by exporting and querying three real-life large
    building models.

    This paper presents the vision behind the McBIM project, funded by the
    French National Agency of Research (ANR). McBIM stands for "Communicating
    Matter for BIM" and is a concept coined by the CRAN laboratory, concept at
    the basis of the scientific contributions of the project. Building upon
    latest advances in Semantic Web technologies, Wireless Sensor Networks and
    digital twins in AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction), the
    project aims at delivering real-time integration of sensor data into
    accurate digital building representations. The overall goal is to enable
    actionable knowledge, meaning knowledge that supports decision making. After
    a brief summary of the issues addressed and the overall project vision, this
    article depicts main contributions made so far in the context of the ANR
    McBIM project. These address semantic interoperability with BIM standards
    (e.g. IFC ISO 16739), routing in wireless sensor networks along with
    autonomic computing.

    This paper presents contributions of the ANR McBIM (Communicating Material
    for BIM) project regarding Digital Building Twins, specifically how Semantic
    Web technologies allow providing explainable decision-support. Following an
    introduction stating our understanding of a Digital Building Twin (DBT),
    namely a lively representation of a buildings' status and environment, we
    identify five main research domains following the study of main research
    issues related to DBT. We then present the state-of-the-art and existing
    standards for digitizing the construction process, Semantic Web
    technologies, and wireless sensor networks. We further position the main
    contributions made so far in the ANR McBIM project's context according to
    this analysis, e.g., sensor placement in the communicating material and
    explainable decision-support.

    Discover BIM: A better way to build better buildings


    Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers a novel approach to design,
    construction, and facility management in which a digital representation of
    the building product and process is used to facilitate the exchange and
    interoperability of information in digital format. BIM is beginning to
    change the way buildings look, the way they function, and the ways in which
    they are designed and built.


    The BIM Handbook, Third Edition provides an in-depth understanding of BIM
    technologies, the business and organizational issues associated with its
    implementation, and the profound advantages that effective use of BIM can
    provide to all members of a project team. Updates to this edition include:


    Information on the ways in which professionals should use BIM to gain
    maximum value

    New topics such as collaborative working, national and major construction
    clients, BIM standards and guides

    A discussion on how various professional roles have expanded through the
    widespread use and the new avenues of BIM practices and services

    A wealth of new case studies that clearly illustrate exactly how BIM is
    applied in a wide variety of conditions

    Painting a colorful and thorough picture of the state of the art in building
    information modeling, the BIM Handbook, Third Edition guides readers to
    successful implementations, helping them to avoid needless frustration and
    costs and take full advantage of this paradigm-shifting approach to
    construct better buildings that consume fewer materials and require less
    time, labor, and capital resources.

  abstract: "Semantic enrichment of building models adds meaningful domain-specific or application-specific information to a digital building model. It is applicable to solving interoperability problems and to compilation of models from point cloud data. The SeeBIM (Semantic Enrichment Engine for BIM) prototype software encapsulates domain expert knowledge in computer readable rules for inference of object types, identity and aggregation of systems. However, it is limited to axis-aligned bounding box geometry and the adequacy of its rule-sets cannot be guaranteed. This paper solves these drawbacks by (1)\_devising a new procedure for compiling inference rule sets that are known a priori to be adequate for complete and thorough classification of model objects, and (2)\_enhancing the operators to compute complex geometry and enable precise topological rule processing. The procedure for compiling adequate rule sets is illustrated using a synthetic concrete highway bridge model. A real-world highway bridge model, with 333 components of 13 different types and compiled from a laser scanned point cloud, is used to validate the approach and test the enhanced SeeBIM system. All of the elements are classified correctly, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach to semantic enrichment."

    Abstract. The trend of increased usage of both BIM and 3D GIS and the
    similarity between the two has led to an increase in the overlap between
    them. A key application of such overlap is providing geospatial context data
    for BIM models through importing 3D GIS-data to BIM software to help in
    different design-related issues. However, this is currently difficult
    because of the lack of support in BIM software for the formats and data
    models of 3D Geo-information. This paper deals with this issue by developing
    and implementing a methodology to convert the common open 3D city model data
    model into the most common open BIM data format, namely CityGML (Gröger et
    al., 2012) to IFC (buildingsmart, 2019b). For the aim of this study, the two
    standards are divided into 5 comparable subparts: Semantics, Geometry,
    Geographical coordinates, Topology, and Encoding. The characteristics of
    each of these subparts are studied and a conversion method is proposed for
    each of them from the former standard to the latter. This is done by
    performing a semantic and geometrical mapping between the two standards,
    converting the georeferencing from global to local, converting the encoding
    that the two standards use from XML to STEP, and deciding which topological
    relations are to be retained. A prototype implementation has been created
    using Python to combine the above tasks. The work presented in this paper
    can provide a foundation for future work in converting CityGML to IFC. It
    provides an insight into the relationship between the two standards and a
    methodology for the conversion from one to the other, and the process of
    developing software to perform such conversion. This is done in a way that
    can be extended for future specific needs.

    Abstract Lack of interoperability has been identified as an obstacle to
    collaboration in BIM (Building Information Modeling). This paper reviews the
    practical context in which interoperability issues are raised in the
    literature. More precisely, the following questions are addressed: what
    exactly is expected from a given BIM data exchange? What is interoperability
    needed for? This review shows that the strong need in interoperability
    between different AEC trades is being addressed in the literature: an
    integrative BIM approach is emerging. However, some gaps persist in more
    basic and fundamental usages, like checking and querying BIM data.

    The upcoming next generation of the Internet, often referred to as the
    semantic Web, will bring a lot of new technologies, one of which is the Web
    ontology language (OWL). One feature of this language is to support
    interoperability between software applications, including Web services and
    intelligent agents. Another technology to bring interoperability between
    software programs is ISO-10303 Standard Exchange of Product data (STEP). The
    industry foundation classes (IFC) have been developed as a building
    information model for the building and construction industry using
    technology from STEP. Converting IFC to OWL can be done on different ways. A
    unidirectional conversion from an IFC to an OWL has been developed for
    research purposes. The developed prototype converts not all the IFC data to
    OWL but supports the search for a more appropriate mapping. As the
    conversion is not straightforward, reengineering the building model to gain
    more advantages of functionality offered by OWL has to be investigated.

    Building Information Modeling (BIM) has brought great benefits to the
    construction industry by gathering all information in a project and making
    it available to the involved stakeholders. However, BIM has predominantly
    generated value in the design phase of a project, while the potential
    benefits in the construction phase have been disregarded for many years and
    are now gaining importance. Trending advancements try to utilize existing
    BIM data, e.g by linking a digital building model with planning efforts of
    the construction project and create new knowledge to improve construction.
    In this paper, we are interested in exploring how semantic models and Linked
    Building Data (LBD) can support value creation in the construction phase.
    The presented use case tries to answer the question how the planning of
    Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by semantically
    describing and classifying TCIs in an ontology that allows to utilize TCI
    information with BIM data. TCIs only experience little attention in the
    current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the
    outcome of a project. Thus, the creation of an ontology in this field shall
    lead to a better and more automated consideration of TCIs in construction
    planning. Here, we follow the recommendation of the W3C - LBD community
    group to extend or develop new ontologies and propose the TCI ontology as
    the main contribution. We first introduce the TCI ontology and its relation
    to other ontologies. Then we demonstrate the value of the ontology by
    answering competency questions and finally provide a proof of concept of
    planning TCIs by utilizing the new ontology. The proposal of the TCI
    ontology is accompanied by a second ontology for Location-Based Scheduling
    (LBS) to consider the time dimension of planning. The main focus, however,
    lies on the development and presentation of the TCI ontology whereas the LBS
    ontology will be further developed in future research.

    Abstract Despite its high potential, the building's sector lags behind in
    reducing its energy demand. Tremendous savings can be achieved by deploying
    building management services during operation, however, the manual
    deployment of these services needs to be undertaken by experts and it is a
    tedious, time and cost consuming task. It requires detailed expert knowledge
    to match the diverse requirements of services with the present constellation
    of envelope, equipment and automation system in a target building. To enable
    the widespread deployment of these services, this knowledge-intensive task
    needs to be automated. Knowledge-based methods solve this task, however,
    their widespread adoption is hampered and solutions proposed in the past do
    not stick to basic principles of state of the art knowledge engineering
    methods. To fill this gap we present a novel methodological approach for the
    design of knowledge-based systems for the automated deployment of building
    management services. The approach covers the essential steps and best
    practices: (1) representation of terminological knowledge of a building and
    its systems based on well-established knowledge engineering methods; (2)
    representation and capturing of assertional knowledge on a real building
    portfolio based on open standards; and (3) use of the acquired knowledge for
    the automated deployment of building management services to increase the
    energy efficiency of buildings during operation. We validate the
    methodological approach by deploying it in a real-world large-scale European
    pilot on a diverse portfolio of buildings and a novel set of building
    management services. In addition, a novel ontology, which reuses and extends
    existing ontologies is presented.

    The BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) is a buildingSMART standard used to
    exchange issues in a digital model between heterogeneous software
    applications and planners. Although the BCF issues are spatially located in
    a model and provide links to building elements, the format is only loosely
    connected to the actual BIM model. While the format is well suited for its
    original use case, it lacks the flexibility to retrieve information from the
    BCF in conjunction with the BIM model. In this paper, we introduce the BIM
    Collaboration Format Ontology (bcfOWL), which translates the format to the
    Semantic Web and harnesses the expressive richness of OWL. We present the
    structure of the ontology and highlight the di erences with existing
    implementations of BCF. Using example queries, we show how extended
    relationships between a BIM model and BCF information are enabled by bcfOWL.
    We show that by transferring BCF to Linked Data, the format's applicability
    is enhanced without losing compatibility with existing implementations and
    workflows. In doing so, the ontology aims to integrate into the Linked
    Building Data environment and facilitates access to synergies between
    heterogeneous building data.

  abstract: >-
    Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a widely established method in the
    architecture, engineering, construction, and facilities management (AEC/FM)
    industry. Although BIM focuses on processes throughout the lifecycle of the
    built environment, the applications in the planning phase, e.g. the
    generation of construction site layouts, have not reached their full
    potential yet. One important example herein is the allocation and
    dimensioning of resources (e.g., building materials and equipment) which is
    typically carried out by humans according to clearly defined rules and best
    practices. This paper presents model-based rule checking for the planning of
    construction site layouts. We demonstrate that existing Business Rule
    Management Systems (BRMS), such as the open-source rule engine Drools, can
    be used. We combine Drools with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to
    retrieve data from a building information model and use the information
    within the rule engine. We define general model requirements and implement a
    sample set of prototype rules. We also introduce the concept of offset
    geometry for rules that, for example, demand a known safety distance between
    temporary construction site elements. The developed approaches are explained
    and evaluated in field-realistic, practical case studies. Finally, we
    present a discussion how the application of the developed rule-based system
    may assist human decision making in tasks such as safe construction sites
    layout planning.

    The project was funded by Business Finland and a consortium of 7 companies:
    Fira, Trimble, Bonava, Consolis, Parma, Ruukki, Sweco.


    Construction industry is suffering from low productivity, high risk of
    delays and cost overruns.

    Globally, productivity growth in construction has averaged only 1 percent a
    year over the past

    two decades, compared with the growth of 2.8 percent for the total world
    economy and 3.6

    percent in manufacturing. At least 20% of the total construction volume is
    waste, 30% of con-

    struction is rework, 40% of jobsite work is unproductive, 40% of projects
    are over budget, and

    90% of projects are late (c.f. Forbes & Ahmed, 2011). Typically this is
    blamed on the seemingly

    complex and chaotic nature of construction production. Complexity arises
    from the fact that

    currently no one has an accurate picture of what has happened and what is
    happening now, and

    there is a very unclear picture of what is going to happen in the future.
    The vision of the DiCtion

    project was to solve these problems by digitalizing construction workflows;
    All construction

    project stakeholders should have a shared understanding of past, current and
    future situation

    picture.

    The DiCtion project investigated various ways to achieve the shared
    situation picture. A key

    challenge that we explored was that different project stakeholders have
    their own view of the

    construction schedule because they are thinking in terms of their own work.
    In earlier attempts

    to resolve this, rigid approaches have been implemented, for example by
    forcing everyone to

    follow the same breakdown of work and locations. However, this rigid
    breakdown does not work

    well for any one of the parties and results in difficulties in updating
    information or adapting to

    changes. Our goal was to allow freedom of action for each stakeholder and to
    be able to combine

    the freely generated information into one, shared, project situation picture
    to enable collabora-

    tive planning. This required research and development related to developing
    underlying data

    models, creating the rules necessary for integrating information on a
    construction project level,

    enabling freedom and collaboration in planning future work, and finally
    finding out in real time

    what has happened before.

    Real-time identification and prevention of safety risks in dynamic
    construction activities are demanded by construction safety managers to cope
    with the growing complexity of the construction site. Most of the studies on
    BIM-based construction safety inspection and prevention use data from the
    planning and design stage. Meanwhile, safety managers still need to spend a
    lot of time gathering reports about construction safety risks in certain
    periods or areas from inferred results in BIM. Therefore, this paper
    proposed an automatic safety risk identification and prevention mechanism
    for the construction process by integrating a safety rule library based on
    ontology technology and Natural Language Processing. An automatic inspection
    mechanism integrating BIM and safety rules is constructed, and a
    presentation mechanism of intelligent detection results based on Natural
    Language Processing is designed. The construction process safety rule
    checking system was developed, and the effectiveness of the system was
    verified by a case study. The outcome of this paper contributes to the
    development and application of ontology in construction safety research, and
    the NLP-based safety rule checking result presentation will benefit safety
    inspectors and construction managers in practice.

  abstract: >-
    This dissertation constitutes a study in the field of automated compliance
    checking, with a concentration on building code representations. Development
    of compliance checking systems has been an area of research that aims to
    provide computational support for accurate compliance checking of building
    projects against applicable building codes in a time and cost effective way.
    Systems for compliance checking of building projects require appropriate
    representations for building codes. Building codes are complex documents
    written in natural languages, and the development of computable
    representations is challenging.

    This dissertation proposes and demonstrates a new representation model and
    an accompanying modeling methodology for representing building codes in
    computable form that can be utilized in the development of automated
    compliance checking systems. The model adopts the four level representation
    paradigm as a theoretical base and uses the semantic modeling approach for
    developing the building code representation. The model breaks down the
    representation into four levels which allows separate modeling of domain
    concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules, and the
    organization of the building code.

    The dissertation shows that decomposing a building code into four levels and
    modeling rules based on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective
    modeling strategy for representing building codes in a computable form that
    is independent of automated compliance checking systems. The applicability
    of the model has been evaluated through a case study. The case study
    successfully illustrates the modeling of building codes that constitute
    parts of İzmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code, as well as a prototype
    implementation of an automated checking system utilizing this building code
    representation.

    Development of automated building code compliance checking systems requires
    appropriate representations for building codes. Building codes are complex
    documents written in natural languages, and the development of computable
    representations is challenging. This paper presents a new model and an
    accompanying modeling methodology for the representation of building codes
    that may be utilized in the development of future automated compliance
    checking systems. The new model combines the semantic modeling approach of
    the SMARTcodes project with the theoretical foundations established by Nyman
    and Fenves, namely the four level representation. This hybrid model
    organizes the representation in four levels and allows for separate modeling
    of domain concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules,
    and the overall organization of the building code. The model is evaluated
    with a case study. The İzmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code is chosen
    as it is representative of complex building codes that are in effect
    throughout Turkey. The formalizable rules in the section of Izmir code that
    apply to all types of buildings, are represented in computer implementable
    format based on the new model. The research presented in this paper shows
    that decomposing a building code into four levels and modeling rules based
    on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective modeling strategy for
    representing building codes in a computable form.

    Safety planning in the construction industry is generally done separately
    from the project

    execution planning. This separation creates difficulties for safety
    engineers to analyze

    what, when, why and where safety measures are needed for preventing
    accidents. Lack of

    information and integration of available data (safety plan, project
    schedule, 2D project

    drawings) during the planning stage often results in scheduling work
    activities with

    overlapping space needs that then can create hazardous conditions, for
    example, work

    above other crew. These space requirements are time dependent and often
    neglected due

    to the manual effort that is required to handle the data. Representation of
    project-specific

    activity space requirements in 4D models hardly happen along with schedule
    and work

    break-down structure. Even with full cooperation of all related
    stakeholders, current

    safety planning and execution still largely depends on manual observation
    and past

    experiences. The traditional manual observation is inefficient, error-prone,
    and the

    observed result can be easily effected by subjective judgments. This paper
    will

    demonstrate the development of an automated safety code checking tool for
    Building

    Information Modeling (BIM), work breakdown structure, and project schedules
    in

    conjunction with safety criteria to reduce the potential for accidents on
    construction

    projects. The automated safety compliance rule checker code builds on
    existing

    applications for building code compliance checking, structural analysis, and

    constructability analysis etc. and also the advances in 4D simulations for
    scheduling.

    Preliminary results demonstrate a computer-based automated tool can assist
    in safety

    planning and execution of projects on a day to day basis

    Linking BIM to other data models is essential to establishing digital twins.
    Recently, ontologies have been used to establish the link between IFC and
    other data models. However, most of the data in digital twins are
    unstructured—for example, specifications, reports, and other communication.
    These types of data dynamically change and incorporate a wide range of
    concepts with complex relationships. It is difficult to develop and maintain
    an ontological representation for such forms of data. This research work
    explored the use of concept networks as means to link BIM to unstructured
    data. Using topic modeling tools, a set of key terms are extracted from
    documents. The relationships between these key terms are investigated. A
    network of these key terms is established. This approach is il-lustrated
    through a case study application to the work order management domain.

    Automated rule checking has been identified as potentially providing
    significant value to the AEC industry from both regulatory and industry
    perspectives. Key challenges to a successful rule checking implementation
    are the complexities inherent in the rules themselves and the breadth of
    conditions to which they need to apply. Due to the large number of building
    codes and theoretically infinite number of rules that can be defined, it is
    critical to systematize the rules to make the task of rule checking
    tractable. This paper is a first step towards classifying automated rule
    checking. In this paper, the authors draw upon their extensive international
    exposure with various building codes and rule checking areas in the AEC
    domain to introduce a general classification of rules across application
    domains using criteria that apply to all known aspects of automated rule
    checking. The exposure covers both academic research as well as actual
    production implementation done with CORENET ePlanCheck project in Singapore,
    and also various pilot implementations in the US and other countries. The
    authors offer a survey of representative examples of different classes of
    rules, their key concepts, potential tools required to implement them, and
    at least one possible solution of each example rule in each category. The
    examples are drawn from both research domains and existing commercial
    applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial guide for
    creating a framework for rule classification that articulates both the
    process challenges and the technology needs to address rule automation.

    Specifications of the exact requirements for BIM-based rules are often much
    more complex than it appears from their direct language interpretation. It
    is because the complete rule interpretation involves knowledge from human
    experts. Therefore, detailed interpretation process of rules for the purpose
    of automated rule checking implementation must be able to capture such
    knowledge and it must be retained throughout the implementation process. In
    order to ensure both completeness and precision, the knowledge capture needs
    to be formalized. We propose a formalized way to capture these requirements
    using a knowledge representation approach. Detailed analysis of the
    structure of the rules points to the conceptual graph (CG) as a suitable
    method for this purpose due to its expressiveness, which allows unambiguous
    description of the requirements. Such unambiguous description can be
    understood by all the participants in the implementation efforts. The
    conceptual graph is a representation that conforms to the first order logic
    that makes it suitable for the job. Using the conceptual graph, rules can be
    broken into their atomic rules and incorporates the unwritten domain
    checking knowledge that if done right will remove ambiguities that often
    plague building codes. It also provides a standardized way to capture and
    document the model data requirements and the high level checking logic as
    their functional requirements. With this, a layer that often separates the
    rule experts and the implementers can be eliminated, resulting in clarity
    and immediate usefulness for the implementation. The validity of this
    assertion is demonstrated using the comparison to the actual corresponding
    implementation of the rules.

    The use of IFC as a standard format in exchange processes has been
    increasing as the industry begins to address the need of interoperability. A
    current problem with the use of IFC is in the quality of product models.
    Much effort has addressed this issue in the form of certifications to ensure
    a minimum quality of exchange requirements for an IFC file. However, even
    with the recent increasing awareness and effort to improve the quality of
    IFC files, the process is still too tedious, time consuming and requires
    manual efforts by experts. Even if those resources are available, there is
    currently no clear and quantifiable definitions of what exactly is a good
    quality IFC file. Without such measures, the adoption of IFC as standard
    exchange format will be hindered and the industry will be left with only
    restricted alternatives that are mostly vendor dependent. This paper sets
    out to address this issue in two aspects: first by defining what a good
    quality IFC model is, and second by proposing rules that can be automated to
    measure with confidence the completeness and correctness of the IFC model.
    These two aspects will serve as a starting point toward a more comprehensive
    and quantifiable measures of the quality of an IFC file. This proposed goal
    is represented by using well defined and well documented rules collected
    from various projects the authors had experienced over the years. The rules
    include all known aspects of IFC, including geometry, which currently
    requires mostly manual validation. The paper also proposes a method to
    address import validation that is under-developed compared to the export
    validation.

    Significant progress has been made towards BIM-based automated

    rule-checking systems. There are multiple approaches that show varying
    potentials as crucial components for open and practical rule checking
    systems. However, in the current state, we are not yet quite there as they
    are still several barriers that prevent the needed shift from
    proof-of-concept to the real-world implementation. This paper reviews
    various language-based rule checking systems that have been proposed and
    assesses their potentials and gaps that need to be overcome for them to
    become practical. It introduces metrics of eleven criteria to analyze
    various approaches to assess their readiness for the real-world
    implementations. The criteria cover a wide range of aspects including
    language

    expressiveness, ease of use to define a rule, openness, level of maturity,
    and performance. These criteria help to identify gaps that currently exist
    that need to be overcome to allow a leap from a proof-of-concept to the
    real-world implementation. From the assessment, it is obvious that no one
    single approach is currently capable of covering the entire spectrum of
    requirements for automated rule-checking systems. The assessment also shows
    that the possibilities of combining two or more approaches may accelerate
    the realization of an open and practical language-driven automated rule
    checking system

    In Search of Open and Practical Language-Driven BIM-Based Automated Rule

    Following decades of research, the potential of automated rule-checking
    applications for building models to boost the productivity in the AECO
    industry has yet to fully materialize. Most efforts have been dedicated to
    dealing with the complexities associated with formalizing rules related to
    building designs for computability. To make automated rule checking
    applications successful, data availability and accessibility are critical
    components that must be addressed. Unfortunately, to-date they have not
    received the same level of attention. 

    To lay a solid foundation for a robust environment of automated BIM-based
    rule-checking systems, this paper proposes a novel approach of transforming
    building data into a simplified schema (BIMRLSS) as a means of addressing
    this critical issue. The paper also describes an implementation of the
    proposed approach on a traditional database management system, which offers
    the primary advantage of facilitating high-performance queries and
    supporting a wide range of query types in real-time. 

    More importantly, this approach not only allows alphanumeric data queries,
    but also enables queries on the geometry by using various spatial operators.
    Allowing complex spatial-based queries provides a means to significantly
    simplify the traditional programmatic approach to BIM-based rule-checking.
    This data-focused approach allows us to lower a significant barrier that
    currently prevents BIM-based rule-checking systems from reaching their full
    potential, making the checking process easier and more robust. To highlight
    the implications and practical benefits of the proposed method, this paper
    also demonstrates several application scenarios by utilizing a wide range of
    queries.

    Healthcare projects are known for having a high degree of complexity.
    Furthermore, the design of healthcare facilities is highly constrained by
    regulations containing a wide range of requirements. Using BIM for automated
    rule checking has been pointed out as an opportunity to improve requirements
    management in these projects. However, most existing research is focused on
    hard-coded approaches or on limited sets of requirements. The aim of this
    investigation is to propose a semantic-based framework for automated rule
    checking in the context of healthcare design. An empirical study was
    conducted in the redevelopment of a university hospital, using Design
    Science Research as a methodological approach. Results indicate that the
    nature of regulations and the subjectivity of requirements have a major
    impact on the possibility of their translation into logical rules, which is
    needed to enable automated checking. The main theoretical contribution is a
    taxonomy for automated rule checking and information transformation.

    This paper aims to describe a natural language processing (NLP) and deep
    learning-based approach for supporting automated rule checking system.
    Automated rule checking has been developed in various ways and enhanced the
    efficiency of building design review process. Converting human-readable
    building regulations to computer-readable format is, however, still
    time-consuming and error-prone due to the nature of human languages. Several
    domain-independent efforts have been made for NLP, and this paper focuses on
    how computers can be able to understand semantic meaning of building
    regulations to intelligently automate rule interpretation process. This
    paper proposes a semantic analysis process of regulatory sentences and its
    utilization for rule checking system. The proposed process is composed of
    following steps: 1) learning semantics of words and sentences, 2)
    utilization of semantic analysis. For semantic analysis, we use word
    embedding technique which converts meaning of words in numerical values. By
    using those values, computers can extract related words and classify the
    topic of sentences. The results of the semantic analysis can elaborate the
    interpretation with domain-specific knowledge. This paper also shows a
    demonstration of the proposed approach.

    The demand and supply of electricity adheres to more complex patterns than
    before. This development confronts TenneT, an organization which transports
    electricity in the Netherlands and Germany, with significant challenges that
    necessitate improvements in methods and processes on projects. Projects at
    TenneT will see work done on over 360 high voltage substations in the
    Netherlands over the next 10 year. For these specific projects, known as
    EU-303 projects, TenneT has opted to follow recent standards and employ
    digitalisation in project management and information exchange. Linked data,
    including the use of Object type libraries and JSON-LD, forms an essential
    part of this digitalisation strategy in facilitating efficiency and accuracy
    in the communication between TenneT and contractors. This paper discusses
    the implementation and use of these technologies on the EU-303 projects.

    Standardisation is an important part of ensuring data interoperability.
    Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the current leading standard for BIM in
    the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and ifcOWL is a
    Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation of IFC, which enables
    the interlinking of IFC models with other building and building related data
    that are also represented using RDF, such as devices, sensor data,
    geolocation, etc. IFC has a complex schema, designed to support parametric
    modelling in AEC and adherence to this schema is required to support
    importing IFC models into popular CAD tools such as Autodesk and ArchiCAD.
    Therefore, for those wishing to create ifcOWL models which can then be
    imported into these tools, a process of validation of the output must be
    done. In this paper, we present a method for validating ifcOWL models using
    SHACL which can be reused by anyone generating ifcOWL models and which
    returns a report highlighting any issues identified. The method is tested to
    validate the outputs of a conversion of geospatial data into IFC using a
    declarative mapping approach called R2RML.

    The current three-dimensionally (3D) delimited property units are in most
    countries registered using two-dimensional (2D) documentation and textual
    descriptions. This approach has limitations if used for representing the
    actual extent of complicated 3D property units, in particular in city
    centers. 3D digital models such as building information model (BIM) and 3D
    geographic information system (GIS) could be utilized for accurate
    identification of property units, better representation of cadastral
    boundaries, and detailed visualization of complex buildings. To facilitate
    this, several requirements need to be identified considering organizational,
    legal, and technical aspects. In this study, we formulate these requirements
    and then develop a framework for integration of 3D cadastre and 3D digital
    models. The aim of this paper is that cadastral information stored based on
    the land administration domain model (LADM) are integrated with BIM on
    building level for accurate representation of legal boundaries and with GIS
    on city level for visualization of 3D cadastre in urban environments. The
    framework is implemented and evaluated against the requirements in a
    practical case study in Sweden. The conclusion is that the integration of
    the cadastral information and BIM/GIS is possible on both conceptual level
    and data level which will facilitate that organizations dealing with
    cadastral information (cadastral units), BIM models (architecture,
    engineering, and construction companies), and GIS (surveying units on e.g.,
    municipality level) can exchange information; this facilitates better
    representation and visualization of 3D cadastral boundaries.

    Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming an integral part of the
    design, architecture, and construction process, as it can integrate all
    building data in an accessible digital representation that can be viewed in
    a 3D environment prior to construction. This supports the capability of
    evaluating a model against building codes or design rules to ensure that the
    building meets the relevant functional and safety requirements for
    occupants. However, building regulations are typically represented in
    natural language and, to date, they have not been created with regard to the
    digital BIM design process. To automate the design evaluation of a building
    model, this paper describes a simple, yet extendable, domain-specific
    language for computationally representing building interior design rules and
    a method for evaluating rules in this language against a BIM model.
    Furthermore, previous language-based model-checking approaches have not
    explored the applicability of their proposed languages beyond model-design
    evaluation. This paper demonstrates the use of our language in a second,
    more complex, use case, namely the automated generation of multiple valid
    alternative model interior designs, compliant to a set of design rules
    expressed in our language. We have evaluated the usefulness of our language
    in two generative-design case studies, namely kitchen layouts using a set of
    real-world kitchen design rules provided by an commercial partner, and
    living-room layouts using rules put forward in earlier automated-design
    research. Therefore, this research bridges the concepts of automated model
    checking and generative design relying on the same rule language.

    A promising approach to Smart Energy Grids is to empower communities of
    consumers with a novel role in the management of their electricity by
    sharing excess electricity and therefore becoming energy producers
    (prosumers). We achieve it using a framework to connect dynamic,
    context-aware, heterogeneous virtual and real entities on the Internet of
    Smart Meters (IoSM). We transform the smart electricity meters into
    fully-fledged intelligent computers on the IoSM and enable them to securely
    collect data from heterogeneous meters and sensors, detect smart meters with
    similar goals, exchange and aggregate data from multiple autonomous physical
    or virtual meters, and manage the actual energy demand and ensure the
    achievement of demand response for the community involved. Domain ontologies
    are used to store the semantics of the collected data from IoSM. A problem
    we have encountered is how our framework can use ontologies for
    community-grounded decision rules, which need to be consistent based on
    aggregation of collected data and contexts. We use Semantic Decision Table
    (SDT), which is a decision table enhanced with ontology technologies, to
    tackle the problem. This paper records our efforts in 1) the general design
    of the framework; 2) decision support models, namely SDTs, for fulfilling
    this requirement; 3) an algorithm of creating invocational SDTs; 4) the
    implementation of visualizing invocational SDTs.

    Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web technologies are
    becoming more and more popular in the Architecture Engineering Construction
    (AEC) and Facilities Management (FM) industry to support information
    management, information exchange and data interoperability. One of the key
    integration gateways between BIM and Semantic Web is represented by the
    ifcOWL ontology, i.e. the Web Ontology Language (OWL) version of the IFC
    standard, being one of reference technical standard for AEC/FM. Previous
    studies have shown how a recommended ifcOWL ontology can be automatically
    generated by converting the IFC standard from the official EXPRESS schema.
    However, the resulting ifcOWL is a large monolithic ontology that presents
    serious limitations for real industrial applications in terms of usability
    and performance (i.e. querying and reasoning). Possible enhancements to
    reduce the complexity and the data size consist in (1) modularization of
    ifcOWL making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology, and (2)
    rethinking the contents and structure of an ontology for AEC/FM to better
    fit in the semantic web scope and make its usage more efficient. The second
    approach can be enabled by the first one, since it would make it easier to
    replace some of the ifcOWL modules with new optimized ontologies for the
    AEC-FM industry. This paper focuses on the first approach presenting a
    method to automatically generate a modular ifcOWL ontology. The method aims
    at minimizing the dependencies between modules to better exploit the
    modularization. The results are compared with simpler and more
    straight-forward solutions.

    Semantic Web technologies are becoming more and more appealing to the
    community of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) users. The recent actions
    towards the development of an OWL version of the IFC schema (named ifcOWL)
    evidence the effort of facing the community request to specify IFC in an
    ontology language. This paper presents an enrichment of the EXPRESS to OWL
    conversion patterns with OWL class expressions that specifically capture
    certain constraints of the IFC standard. The presented class expressions can
    be used to improve the robustness of ifcOWL and support data integrity,
    consistency, and applicability across various scenarios of industrial
    application. In particular, the rules defining the relationships between
    non-abstract subtypes of IfcObject and corresponding subtypes of
    IfcTypeObject are analyzed and converted into novel class expressions. The
    proposed additions to the conversion pattern have been implemented into a
    software tool and the resulting ontology was tested against a use case to
    show the benefits of the new solution with respect to a basic ifcOWL. The
    novel conversion pattern enhances usability of the ifcOWL ontology by
    enabling its direct instantiation, without necessarily going through the
    intermediate generation of a STEP physical format that is then converted
    into an ontology.

    Linked data and semantic web technologies are gaining impact and importance
    in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facility Management
    (AEC/FM) industry. Whereas we have seen a strong technological shift with
    the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools, this second
    technological shift to the exchange and management of building data over the
    web might be even stronger than the first one. In order to make this a
    success, the AEC/FM industry will need strong and appropriate ontologies, as
    they will allow industry practitioners to structure their data in a commonly
    agreed format and exchange the data. Herein, we look at the ontologies that
    are emerging in the area of Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS).
    We propose a BACS ontology in strong alignment with existing ontologies and
    evaluate how it can be used for capturing automation and control systems of
    a building by modeling a use case.

    Context: Definition of a comprehensive facility data model is a prerequisite
    for providing more advanced energy management systems capable of tackling
    the underlying heterogeneity of complex infrastructures, thus providing more
    flexible data interpretation and event management, advanced communication
    and control system capabilities. Objective: This paper proposes one of the
    possible implementations of a facility data model utilizing the concept of
    ontology as part of the contemporary Semantic Web paradigm. Method: The
    proposed facility ontology model was defined and developed to model all the
    static knowledge (such as technical vendor data, proprietary data types, and
    communication protocols) related to the significant energy consumers of the
    target infrastructure. Furthermore, this paper describes the overall
    methodology and how the common semantics offered by the ontology were
    utilized to improve the interoperability and energy management of complex
    infrastructures. Initially, a core facility ontology, which represents the
    generic facility model providing the general concepts behind the modelling,
    was defined. Results: In order to develop a full-blown model of the specific
    facility infrastructure, Malpensa and Fiumicino airports in Italy were taken
    as a test-bed platform in order to develop the airport ontology owing to the
    variety of the technical systems installed at the site. For the development
    of the airport ontology, the core facility ontology was first extended and
    then populated to reflect the actual state of the target airport facility.
    Conclusion: The developed ontology was tested in the environment of the two
    pilots, and the proposed solution proved to be a valuable link between
    separate ICT systems involving equipment from various vendors, both on
    syntax and semantic level, thus offering the facility managers the ability
    to retrieve high-level information regarding the performance of significant
    energy consumers.

    This paper presents two renovation management tools that are currently being
    developed in BIM4EEB project: BIMPlanner—a planning and management tool for
    housing renovation projects —and BIM4Occupants—a coordination tool between
    contractors and occupants. An information-sharing layer, based on ontologies
    and linked data technologies, is an essential technical enabler of these
    tools. The layer allows data sharing across the different components of the
    toolkit. The tools aim to enhance information sharing between renovation
    stakeholders and to enrich BIM data with links to other relevant data in
    renovation projects.

    This study reports on the requirements for developing computer-interpretable
    rules for checking the compliance of a building design in a request for
    proposal (RFP), especially in the building information modeling (BIM)
    environment. It focuses on RFPs for large public buildings (over 5million
    dollars) in South Korea, which generally entail complex designs. A total of
    27 RFPs for housing, office, exhibition, hospital, sports center, and
    courthouse projects were analyzed to develop computer-interpreted RFP rules.
    Each RFP was composed of over 1800 sentences. Of these, only three to 366
    sentences could be translated into a computer-interpretable sentence. For
    further analysis, this study deployed context-free grammar (CFG) in natural
    language processing, and classified morphemes into four categories: i.e.,
    object (noun), method (verb), strictness (modal), and others. The
    subcategorized morphemes included three types of objects, twenty-nine types
    of methods, and five levels of strictness. The coverage applicability of the
    derived objects and methods was checked and validated against three
    additional RFP cases and then through a test case using a newly developed
    model checker system. The findings are expected to be useful as a guideline
    and basic data for system developers in the development of a generalized
    automated design checking system for South Korea.

    The 27th EG-ICE International Workshop 2020 brings together international
    experts working at the interface between advanced computing and modern
    engineering challenges. Many engineering tasks require open-world
    resolutions to support multi-actor collaboration, coping with approximate
    models, providing effective engineer-computer interaction, search in
    multi-dimensional solution spaces, accommodating uncertainty, including
    specialist domain knowledge, performing sensor-data interpretation and
    dealing with incomplete knowledge. While results from computer science
    provide much initial support for resolution, adaptation is unavoidable and
    most importantly, feedback from addressing engineering challenges drives
    fundamental computer-science research. Competence and knowledge transfer
    goes both ways.

    The 27th EG-ICE International Workshop 2020 brings together international
    experts working at the interface between advanced computing and modern
    engineering challenges. Many engineering tasks require open-world
    resolutions to support multi-actor collaboration, coping with approximate
    models, providing effective engineer-computer interaction, search in
    multi-dimensional solution spaces, accommodating uncertainty, including
    specialist domain knowledge, performing sensor-data interpretation and
    dealing with incomplete knowledge. While results from computer science
    provide much initial support for resolution, adaptation is unavoidable and
    most importantly, feedback from addressing engineering challenges drives
    fundamental computer-science research. Competence and knowledge transfer
    goes both ways.

    Managing infrastructure assets — street furniture, buildings, escalators,
    landing guidance systems, toilet doors — requires data that are findable,
    accessible, interoperable, and reusable: FAIR data. Making this happen is a
    huge challenge. But succeed and you get much more value from your assets. By
    optimizing the planning of maintenance work, Dutch rail infrastructure
    company ProRail managed to cut maintenance cost by 10%. Data can yield
    enormous value but making them FAIR takes effort. In this presentation, we
    report some of the results of a small-scale proof of concept called SIDO and
    will demonstrate the core functionality of the solution we created. It shows
    that projects to make data FAIR can be small in scope and still yield
    immediate benefits. Thus, the FAIR data challenge can be met in a stepwise
    manner. The SIDO-case is about sharing data between parties that do work
    under ground. Better methods of sharing data make it possible to better
    coordinate planning. The result is that a street needs to be closed for
    digging only once, while multiple parties execute their maintenance work on
    their separate underground assets. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water
    Management took the initiative for the project and funded it, and it was
    executed with Evides, the water company of the Rotterdam region, and other
    parties that own underground assets in the same area. Together with CGI, we
    at Taxonic realized a solution based on free open-source components,
    delivering a prototype of a SIDO-cooperation space based on FAIR data. Data
    science techniques are promising, but creating FAIR data already starts
    yielding benefits even when more modest goals are pursued. FAIR data can
    lead to significant improvements in essential, basic primary processes where
    data science plays no role (yet). To introduce FAIR data in an organisation,
    small incremental steps can be taken, each with a solid business case. This
    is what the SIDO-case is about. Utility companies must be able to gain
    access to their equipment under ground. These works need to be coordinated
    to minimize cost and traffic disruption. There is a great potential for
    cooperation, and of course efforts are made to make this happen — in the
    past and present. But cooperation is easier said than done. Data about
    underground assets are sensitive and not to be shared irresponsibly. We
    created a FAIR data solution to support this. The essential ingredient of
    the solution is a semantic data model in RDF, including some OWL and SHACL.
    When asset owners publish data about planned works conforming to this
    semantic model, other asset owners can instantly see with whom they might
    cooperate when planning their works. We will relate the SIDO case to other
    real-world developments in the asset management domain where RDF-based
    solutions play a central role. Also, we will demo the functionality of the
    SIDO solution.

    The exchange of construction-related data over the Web via Semantic Web
    Technologies is gaining interest in current research. However, most research
    focuses on non-geometric data, neglecting the description of geometry. While
    several methods to include geometry descriptions into a Semantic Web context
    exist, no uniform approach or general recommendation exists for the
    endeavour of describing building components in their entirety – including
    geometric descriptions –, leading to an increased suspension in applying
    Semantic Web Technologies in the construction domain. To therefore ease the
    description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an
    extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated
    implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on
    requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we
    group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare
    them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits
    individual use cases. The identified approaches vary in their depth of the
    geometry description's integration into the Semantic Web and are
    subsequently studied regarding their overall aptness and characteristics in
    consideration of their application for future industry and research
    projects. In respect of the ongoing research in the field of the application
    of Semantic Web Technologies, not only in the construction domain, this
    article poses as an important foundation by giving a clear overview of
    existing implementations and relevant open research questions. Having this
    overview, the suspense for adapting to Semantic Web methods for describing
    geometries can be overcome by users more easily, while software developers
    can start to connect their clients' use cases to suitable approaches and
    related implementations to represent geometry in a Semantic Web context.

    The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become popular in the
    architectural, engineering, construction and Operations (AECO) industry, and
    BIM has been used in the lifecycle of projects. As more data is added to a
    BIM model, the complexity and data volume of the model increases. Further,
    many design changes are made to a building information model during design
    and construction phases, and it is difficult to extract and visualize the
    changed objects. Research on the use of ontology in BIM is also limited. The
    purpose of this study therefore is to use an ontology to visualize revised
    objects in BIM models. This research uses the Industry Foundation Classes
    (IFC) format, a widely-supported open standard for building information
    models. The changed objects in the BIM model are extracted by comparing the
    revised model to the original model, and a model report of the design change
    is provided. A prototype program using a sample IFC model is developed to
    validate the system. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is
    valid for the extraction and visualization of design changes in BIM models.

    To increase the transparency of building systems amongst all stakeholders
    and to improve the efficiency throughout the building lifecycle, Bosch
    Building Technologies is providing an open-source library of ontologies and
    a series of smart building software services using Digital Twin (DT)
    technology. In this presentation, we would like to share our experiences
    using ontologies and DT for building comfort & energy optimization. Firstly,
    a brief introduction to the Ontology Central will be made, which is an
    open-source Digital Twin Description Language (DTDL) ontology library for
    commercial buildings. Currently, three ontology models, namely the
    Foundation, Fire Alarm Systems, and HVAC Systems are provided and can be
    reused across buildings, systems, and services. Among them, the Foundation
    Ontology offers the digital common foundation layer for domain-specific
    ontologies and is motivated by several RDF ontology models e.g. Building
    Topology Ontology (BOT) and Brick. A pipeline that supports the conversion
    between the DTDL and RDF format is under development. Currently, a mapping
    between the Foundation ontology and the BOT ontology in perspective of space
    and asset is supported and will be presented. Afterwards, a smart analytic
    software service for building and its HVAC system called “HVAC Performance
    Analyzer” will be introduced, which deploys the Bosch ontologies and
    provides overall information about the building comfort as well as the
    system operation, based on the assessment of measured data. Several
    buildings of Bosch and its customers are on-boarded, monitored, and
    continuously managed by this service. Lastly, the successful deployment of
    the proposed ontology models as digital twin instances on the Microsoft
    Azure Digital Twin platform and corresponding analysis will be demonstrated.
    Smart building algorithms, called as Domain Expert Insight Models (DEIMs)
    for fault detection and predictive maintenance are developed. A
    proof-of-concept (PoC) study deploying the DEIM algorithm for energy
    optimization will be shown. Thanks to the DT and ontology models, the smart
    algorithms can be applied to other existing buildings without any
    modifications. The PoC study proves that DT plays a vital role in enabling
    scalable solutions to energy system optimization in the near future. One
    ongoing research of Bosch will be to onboard existing buildings with
    open-source RDF ontology and to enable further data analytics using semantic
    web technology. In summary, this presentation provides an overview of the
    development of ontology and DT applications of Bosch Building Technologies,
    which is believed to be invaluable to the facility management community.

    As thinking moves away from 3D visualisation towards information quality and
    speed of data exchange, [1], the architectural, engineering and construction
    (AEC) industry is seeking efficiency by the automation of checking. This
    study aims to examine the current quality of the checking in design, how it
    is controlled, and the adoption of automatic checking using rule-based
    checking software. It is based on the hypotheses that there is a need of
    automation which will improve quality; a need of a means to achieve
    automation and a need for understanding in industry. After investigation of
    quality in design, this paper poses three questions; first can a quality
    system be applied to automatic checking in design; second if the potential
    for rule-based checking is understood and utilised could quality be assured;
    and third can we identify the optimal balance between manual and automatic
    checking. Conclusion shows that AEC professionals have low confidence in the
    quality of design data; the current balance is heavily in favour of manual
    checking; and while the potential for automatic checking is known, its
    current utilisation is lacking, due to complexity, poor software support and
    lack of training. Alarmingly there is an indication that the majority
    dealing with automatic checking have no system of validation for new
    checking rules and only a minority had training in rule authorship.

  abstract: >-
    Rule checking for building designs has been universally acknowledged to have
    the tremendous potential to improve the quality and safety of buildings.
    Traditionally, it is viewed as a tool to assist the building code checking
    process. With the advances in BIM and its broad adoption in the past years,
    it is assumed that we are closer to the realization of an automated rule
    checking system for building designs with BIM as the enabler. BIM has
    brought us the integration of building information and its 3D intelligent
    objects into building models. It has bridged the gap between the theory,
    proposed in the 1970s, and the practice. With it, it is viewed that the task
    to develop an automated rule checking system becomes easier. However,
    despite many years of research and development in this area, we have not
    seen the progress we hoped to see. There is only one commercial application
    available today that is considered successful, i.e. Solibri model checker
    (SMC), and one turnkey implementation at the national level with CORENET
    ePlanCheck in Singapore. Even then, they have not really reached their full
    potential. Various research efforts have tried to address this issue. They
    focus on different aspects of the issues of rule checking. Some progress has
    been made, but the challenges stubbornly remain. In fact, the challenges
    actually increase with the rising popularity of BIM. No longer is it just
    about code checking compliance, but it has also widened to include all
    aspects of the building design, including the quality of building modelling,
    which is the focus of SMC, using BIM to improve the overall process of
    building lifecycles, specific domain best practices, etc. With such a wide
    range of requirements, an automated rule checking system appears to be still
    beyond reach.

    This research has ambitious goals, and focuses on looking for a holistic
    solution to the challenges of an automated rule checking system for building
    designs. This is a response from real world experience in implementing the
    CORENET ePlanCheck system and the subsequent development to improve its
    implementation, along with a fresh approach to the same issue with the rule
    checking initiative at Autodesk using Navisworks. The experience indicates
    that it is insufficient to address the issues with piecemeal approaches,
    solving one part of the issue while leaving the others open. The reason is
    that rule checking requires an integrated approach. An efficient software
    tool can only work efficiently in tandem with efficient access to the data.
    Likewise, the BIM data must be accessible for the checking to be performed
    efficiently, but the schema design needs to match the expectation for rule
    checking. Additionally, there is great complexity in dealing with 3D
    geometry and spatial queries that are often inseparable from building rules,
    and with the enormous variations of the rules. To approach this problem
    holistically, this research looks at the problem from the macro level and
    zooms into the micro level in a systematic and integrated manner. At the
    highest level, rules need to be classified into four different classes of
    complexity as viewed from their potential implementation. The classification
    considers major components needed to solve the problem and the high level
    identification of the algorithms needed. Through this exercise, there is a
    recognition that the complexity of the rule implementation relates directly
    to the complexity of the checking requirements and the concept of derived
    objects that involve higher level semantic concepts. For the higher level
    classifications, higher level semantics need to be supported typically by
    some kind of geometry and graph engines. Most rules including building codes
    can be addressed with support for up to class-3 rules. The increment of
    complexity between the classes is not linear and the chasm between classes
    can be wide. The first step of this research involves analyzing how to
    narrow the chasm and reduce the complexity, so that developing an automated
    rule checking system will be relatively easy with minimal development effort
    required, with the exception of very complex rules and those with very
    specific requirements.

    The second step in this research is to analyze various rules and break down
    their structure into a systematic and computable form. The suitable form of
    documentation is in a form of knowledge engineering known as the Conceptual
    Graph (CG). Using CG, various rules are analyzed and broken down into their
    basic concepts and the relationship between concepts. The CG will force the
    breakdown of rules into their atomic rules, the most basic form that
    identifies what really needs to be checked. At the same time CG is also very
    useful in capturing knowledge of the rules that includes entities,
    properties, their relationship and functions that operate on the entities.
    This may even include entities at the higher semantic level. The CG is an
    important step in the rule analysis or rule interpretation since if done
    properly it will remove ambiguity often found in building codes. At the same
    time the outcome can be mapped directly to the data model needed and the
    design for computer implementation.

    With the knowledge derived from the above two steps of analyses, three major
    components are identified to provide a backbone for an automated rule
    checking system that can simplify its implementation and use. All these
    three components represent the major innovations that this research
    advances, i.e. the use of a star-like schema to simplify IFC data for high
    performance queries, the approach to use multiple representations for
    geometry data, and a query-based extensible BIM rule language that allows
    simple to complex rule definitions. There are other minor innovations that
    this research also produces, i.e. a non-overlapping octree based spatial
    indexing for efficient spatial operations, and the methodology and format to
    capture rule requirements using the Conceptual Graph.

    The first major component is providing an efficient access to BIM data.
    While the IFC schema is good in facilitating data exchange, it is too
    complex for efficient queries of the data. The inherent tree-like
    hierarchical structure of the object based model in IFC and its select types
    make it hard to perform quick and dynamic queries. Therefore, this research
    explores an approach similar to the Data Warehousing concept that transforms
    building models from the IFC schema into a relatively flat, star-like
    database schema. This one way extract, transform and load (ETL) approach
    provides an optimized way to query the model. It essentially transforms the
    BIM data into a discoverable and query- able database.

    As concluded from the analysis of rule complexity, alphanumeric based data
    in the database is not sufficient to address the most useful rule checking
    requirements. This leads us to the second component that involves an
    integrated support for the 3D geometry and spatial operators to the
    geometry. A similar concept that has been successfully done in the mostly 2D
    GIS domain is adopted and extended for 3D geometry. In this approach both
    the alphanumeric and the geometry data now reside in the same database and
    can be queried together using a standard SQL. This brings a positive
    implication that the BIM data is now open and accessible provided that the
    geometry data can also be queried and standard spatial operations can be
    applied. Efficient queries can be achieved using a 3D spatial indexing based
    on Octree structure and multiple representations by denormalizing the
    geometry data into its basic and most often accessed data for rule checking.


    Finally, the third major component in the rule checking system is the glue
    to all the other components and concepts, i.e. a domain specific rule
    language simply named BIM Rule Language (BIMRL). BIMRL makes use of the
    query-able BIM data in the database that is integrated with the geometry and
    its basic spatial operators. It takes a form that is identified from the
    study of the rule structure that follows the form of a triplet statement:
    CHECK – EVALUATE – ACTION. It is built on top of an SQL interface, but it is
    simplified for a specific purpose: to capture building rules as simply as
    possible. The goal is to make rule checking to be easy to define and run,
    even by rule experts who are usually not programmers. The language inherits
    the power and flexibility of the relational concept that provides simple to
    complex queries almost always at will. In this way the language will become
    an analysis tool to be used to perform any type of check on the building
    model. Recognizing that it is not possible to have a language that can
    perform all imaginable rules, BIMRL is designed to allow for an extension
    using an evaluation function. The extension will facilitate rule checking
    that involves operations that are harder to perform or for specialized
    checking requirements and add them as component plug-ins to BIMRL. They can
    take advantage of the query capability and rule structure in BIMRL without
    changing the structure of the language itself.


    A software prototype has been developed as a proof that the concept is able
    to solve the problem of rule checking, which is what this research really
    aims to solve. The prototype involves the following capabilities:

    1. The ability to query and check the building model without expensive and
    heavy technical or programming requirements.

    2. The ability to perform checks on both the properties and geometry of the
    building model.

    3. Flexibility that is built into the language to allow queries with open
    ended sets

    4. The ability to perform class-1 to class-3 rules (at least part of
    class-3) without additional extensions).


    Using the prototype software, this thesis demonstrates how effective the
    approach is when it is applied to real-world building models (which includes
    the typical architectural, structural and MEP elements) using several
    representative rules. This prototype covers all the aspects discussed in
    this research, i.e. the database star-like schema, its ETL, 3D geometry
    support and its spatial indexing, the associated multiple representations,
    graph support in the database, and the BIMRL language parser and simple user
    interface with support for visual reporting using an open standard X3D
    format.


    This research demonstrates that the holistic approach to the automated
    building rule checking problem takes it closer to realizing the true
    potential of rule checking systems. The author believes that it can even
    serve as an analysis tool to provide a decision support system regarding
    BIM. With its accessibility by rule experts or even modelers, BIMRL opens up
    a lot more avenues for research and uses of rule checking and analysis on
    BIM data.

  abstract: >-
    With the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the construction
    industry is rapidly catching up with the digital revolution that has boosted
    productivity in virtually all economic sectors. In current practice, the
    focus of BIM lies on exchange of documents, often through proprietary
    formats exchanged using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). However, with
    web technologies such as RDF, OWL and SPARQL, a data- and web-based BIM
    paradigm becomes within reach. The decentralisation of data and decoupling
    of information and applications will enhance a more general adoption of Big
    Open BIM, and is expected to lower the BIM threshold for smaller companies
    that are active in different phases of the building life cycle. Since one of
    the promises of the Semantic Web and Linked Data is a highly improved
    interoperability between different disciplines, it is not necessary to
    reinvent the wheel for the setup of an infrastructure that supports such a
    network of decentralised tools and data. In this paper, we evaluate the
    specifications provided by the Solid project (Inrupt Inc.), a Linked
    Data-based ecosystem for Social Linked Data. Although the exemplary use case
    of the Solid ecosystem is decentralisation of data and applications for
    social network purposes, we notice a considerable overlap with recent
    ambitions and challenges for a web-based AECO industry (Architecture,
    Engineering, Construction and Operation). This includes standardised data
    representations, role- or actor-based authorisation and authentication and
    the need for modular and extensible applications, dedicated to a specific
    use case. After a brief introduction to Linked Data and its applications in
    the building industry, we discuss present solutions for building data
    management (Common Data Environments, multimodels, etc.). In order to
    translate these approaches towards a Linked Data context with minimal effort
    and maximal effect, we then review the Solid specifications for use in a
    construction-oriented web ecosystem. As a proof of concept, we discuss the
    setup of a web-service for creation and management of Linked Building Data,
    generated with the Solid-React generator. This application is envisaged as a
    bridge between the multiple data stores of different project stakeholders
    and the end user. It acts as an interface to a distributed Common Data
    Environment that also allows the generation of multi-models.

    Web-based construction projects rapidly become commonplace. Domain-specific
    collaboration platforms, the so-called Common Data Environments (CDEs),
    facilitate complex interactions between the various offices participating in
    a project. CDEs are developed and maintained by the large BIM companies
    allowing deep integration with BIM authoring tools. Notwithstanding the
    benefits such integration offers, usage of proprietary tools, data models
    and platforms holds the risk of a vendor lock-in and creates dependencies on
    platform APIs as the sole funnels trough which project data can be accessed
    - even when using open data formats. Recently, technologies for
    re-decentralising the Web are causing furore, as they allow decoupling data
    storage from applications. The Solid initiative bundles these technologies
    in a domain-independent way. In previous work we have already discussed data
    patterns for the AEC industry, using these technologies - the LBDserver. In
    this paper, we demonstrate how these very generic data organisation patterns
    can be aligned with common industry standards - facilitating compatibility
    with existing, centralised approaches while maintaining the benefits of
    organising digital projects in a federated way.

    Few industries are as fragmented as the building sector: during the life
    cycle of an asset, countless stakeholders are involved, ranging from direct
    stakeholders such as the architect, the owner and the facility manager
    towards indirect data providers like governments or geospatial institutions.
    This `federated' reality contrasts with the concept of a `centralised' cloud
    server; a `Common Data Environment' (CDE). In this paper, we propose a basic
    infrastructure for a `federated CDE', using domain-agnostic Web
    specifications for (access-controlled) data federation. This infrastructure
    is illustrated via a proof-of-concept implementation, based on the
    open-source Community Solid Server.

    As the building industry is rapidly catching up with digital
    advancements, and Web technologies grow in both maturity and secu-
    rity, a data- and Web-based construction practice comes within reach. In
    such an environment, private project information and open online data
    can be combined to allow cross-domain interoperability at data level,
    using Semantic Web technologies. As construction projects often feature
    complex and temporary networks of stakeholder firms and their employ-
    ees, a property-based access control mechanism is necessary to enable a
    flexible and automated management of distributed building projects. In
    this article, we propose a method to facilitate such mechanism using ex-
    isting Web technologies: RDF, SHACL, WebIDs, nanopublications and
    the Linked Data Platform. The proposed method will be illustrated with
    an extension of a custom nodeJS Solid server. The potential of the Solid
    ecosystem has been put forward earlier as a basis for a Linked Data-based
    Common Data Environment: its decentralised setup, connection of both
    RDF and non-RDF resources and fine-grained access control mechanisms
    are considered an apt foundation to manage distributed building data.

    Buildings are increasingly equipped with data monitoring infrastructures to
    collect multiple layers of dynamic data pertaining to the states and events
    related to systems’ performance, indoor-environmental conditions, occupants’
    location, movement, and control-oriented actions representation of dynamic
    building related data. Efficiently utilized, this data could not only
    enhance the quality and effectiveness of buildings’ operational regimes, but
    also enrich the knowledge base for building design decision support.
    However, to exploit the potential of this data effectively, seamless data
    transformation processes are needed, starting from raw monitoring data and
    ending in adequately structured and visualized building performance data. In
    the present contribution, we provide a detailed blueprint of a well-defined
    and ontologically supported instance of such a transformation process. To
    illustrate this process, we focus in this paper on a specific class of
    building performance queries that require information on buildings’ visually
    relevant boundary conditions. Such queries pertain to, for example, the
    intensity of incident solar radiation of buildings’ envelope components, the
    daylight availability and 114distribution in interior spaces, and the
    expected output of building-integrated solar energy harvesting systems.

    Data are continuously generated during the lifetime of the building, and
    mainly stored in Building Information Models (BIMs) and Building Automation
    Systems (BASs). BIMs store the static and spatial design and construction
    data, while BASs store the dynamic/temporal operational data. The data from
    these two e-resources are highly complementary. Effective data integration
    can provide a more complete spatiotemporal description of a building and
    bridge information gaps among different stages of a building life cycle. The
    data integration also facilitates the transition of the AEC industry in the
    pervasive big data revolution. This chapter first reviews BIM and BAS data
    exchanges and integration schemas and their applications in building energy
    management. Then, the challenges in analyzing big building data are
    identified. After that, a big data analysis framework incorporating machine
    learning for utilizing big building data is proposed and demonstrated.
    Finally, this chapter is concluded with remarks on prospects and challenges.

    A large number of different forms of energy consumption information are
    generated during facility management. In addition, due to the uncertain and
    ambiguous external and internal environment of construction project, it is
    an important issue in energy consumption for operation staff to query
    required information efficiently. Moreover, implementations of BIM
    technology can provide visualization and integrated information models for
    FM. In view of the above two aspects, this paper introduces ontology as the
    modeling approach for information exchange and put forward a semantic
    retrieval method based on ontology for building energy management. Then this
    paper realizes the integration between ontology based semantic retrieval
    system and energy consumption information under BIM environment. In the case
    study, this paper constructs a domain ontology of energy consumption and
    then conducts retrieval expansion based on this information model, and the
    discussion of example provides support for further research.

  abstract: "To fully automate building code compliance checking, regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted and transformed from building codes. Existing regulatory requirement processing efforts mainly focus on building code requirements in text. A more efficient approach for processing regulatory requirements in other parts of building codes, such as tables or charts, remains to be addressed. The ability to process building code requirements in all parts and formats is necessary for an automated code compliance checking system to achieve full coverage of checkable building code requirements. To address this gap, the authors propose a semiautomated information extraction and transformation method. The proposed method can extract building code requirements in tables and convert extracted information to logic rules. Automated code compliance checking systems can utilize the logic rules. The proposed method includes two main steps: (1)\_tabular information extraction, and (2)\_rule generation. The tabular information extraction semiautomatically detects the layout of tables, extracts building code requirements from tables, and transforms extracted information to databases. The rule generation step automatically generates logic rules that can be directly executed by logic reasoners. The rule generation step also provides options for users to further refine the generated rules. The development of the tabular information extraction algorithm takes an iterative approach. An experiment was conducted to develop a tabular information extraction algorithm from a section of existing code. The primary version of the algorithm correctly processed 91.67% of tables in a second sample section. After iterative refinements, the updated tabular information extraction algorithm correctly processed all tables in this section. The rule generation algorithm correctly generated logic rules that successfully represented the applicable building code requirements for a testing building, a convenience store in Texas based on the tabular information."

    The nation’s massive underground utility infrastructure must comply with a
    multitude of regulations. The regulatory compliance checking of underground
    utilities requires an objective and consistent interpretation of the
    regulations. However, utility regulations contain a variety of
    domain-specific terms and numerous spatial constraints regarding the
    location and clearance of underground utilities. It is challenging for the
    interpreters to understand both the domain and spatial semantics in utility
    regulations. To address the challenge, this paper adopts an ontology and
    rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automate the
    interpretation of utility regulations – the extraction of regulatory
    information and the subsequent transformation into logic clauses. Two new
    ontologies have been developed. The urban product ontology (UPO) is
    domain-specific to model domain concepts and capture domain semantics on top
    of heterogeneous terminologies in utility regulations. The spatial ontology
    (SO) consists of two layers of semantics – linguistic spatial expressions
    and formal spatial relations – for better understanding the spatial language
    in utility regulations. Pattern-matching rules defined on syntactic features
    (captured using common NLP techniques) and semantic features (captured using
    ontologies) were encoded for information extraction. The extracted
    information elements were then mapped to their semantic correspondences via
    ontologies and finally transformed into deontic logic (DL) clauses to
    achieve the semantic and logical formalization. The approach was tested on
    the spatial configuration-related requirements in utility accommodation
    policies. Results show it achieves a 98.2% precision and a 94.7% recall in
    information extraction, a 94.4% precision and a 90.1% recall in semantic
    formalization, and an 83% accuracy in logical formalization.

    Computer-aided compliance checking is always a challenge in the
    Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) domain. In recent years,
    semantic compliance checking has gained a lot of attention. As the critical
    ingredient of the checking system, rule information needs to be extracted
    from regulatory texts and be formalized into machine-readable format. This
    paper proposed a semantic frame-based information extraction method with a
    focus on domain semantics and lexical semantics. The extraction process is
    characterized by the enrichment of lexical semantic frames and the mapping
    with the domain semantic framework. Natural language processing (NLP) and
    machine learning (ML) techniques were used to implement the extraction
    mechanism. The preliminary experiment shows a promising performance when
    extracting rule information from Indian Utility Accommodation Policy.

    Buildings account for a majority of the primary energy consumption of the
    human society, therefore, analyses of building energy consumption monitoring
    data are of significance to the discovery of anomalous energy usage
    patterns, saving of building utility expenditures, and contribution to the
    greater environmental protection effort. This paper presents a unified
    framework for the automatic extraction and integration of building energy
    consumption data from heterogeneous building management systems, along with
    building static data from building information models to serve analysis
    applications. This paper also proposes a diagnosis framework based on
    density-based clustering and artificial neural network regression using the
    integrated data to identify anomalous energy usages. The framework and the
    methods have been implemented and validated from data collected from a
    multitude of large-scale public buildings across China.

    With ongoing advancements in information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) in all stages of the construction lifecycle, information from
    entities related to construction workflow (CW) can now be automatically
    collected. These implementations are point solutions, which require
    systematic integration to combine their information to enable a holistic
    picture of CW. The major barrier to such integration is information
    heterogeneity, where the information is collected from different systems
    under multiple contexts. Scholars in the construction domain have explored
    the use of ontology to solve the information-integration problem, although
    an ontology that both adequately represents the CW and integrates the
    digitalized information of CW via various systems and multiple contexts is
    currently missing from the existing literature. This research thus presents
    an ontology set for formalizing and integrating CW information within the
    digital construction context. The proposed digital construction ontologies
    (DiCon) are shared representations of construction domain knowledge that
    specify the terms and relations of CWs and their related information. We
    developed the DiCon based on a hybrid ontology development approach. The
    DiCon includes six modules: Entities, Processes, Information, Agents,
    Variables, and Contexts. The developed DiCon was further evaluated by
    approaches including automatic consistency checking, criteria-based
    evaluation, expert workshops, and task-based evaluation and involved two use
    cases by answering relevant competency questions via SPARQL queries. The
    results of the evaluation demonstrate that the DiCon ontologies are
    sufficient to represent domain knowledge and can formalize and integrate CW
    information within the digital construction context.

    This paper presents an ontology-based method for the formalisation and
    application of construction conformance requirements for effective code
    checking. This research continues our work on the development of a generic
    model automating the conformance checking of construction projects against
    building codes. We start from the analysis of the related research on the
    formalisation and organisation of building codes that allows us to formulate
    our approach for semantic annotation and scheduling of conformance
    requirements for conformance checking task. Our approach comprises 5 main
    steps: formalisation, semantic annotation, classification, context-based
    scheduling and semantic search of conformance requirements. They are
    implemented as corresponding key components of the C3R (Conformance Checking
    in Construction — Reasoning) prototype that we have developed to model the
    conformance checking process in construction. Finally, we discuss the
    ongoing work and perspectives of our research: the validation of our model
    by construction practices and the enrichment of our approach by usage-based
    knowledge.

    Industry 4.0 embraces digitization and smart products or processes that are
    integrated with several technological developments to control the entire
    value chain of workflows. The construction industry is also captivated with
    the idea of Industry 4.0 transformation that changes the traditional system
    into digital and cyber-physical system that interacts and connects across
    the geographical and organizational borders. However, as construction is
    commonly known as a low-technologically advanced industry, studies on
    Industry 4.0 in construction still remains elusive, as compared to other
    sectors such as manufacturing, electrical and electronic engineering and
    computer science. Therefore, this study aims to explore the current state of
    Industry 4.0 application from the construction engineering perspective. A
    systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify publications
    related to Industry 4.0 in construction. A bibliometric analysis has been
    outlined through exclusion and inclusion principles, while a scientometric
    analysis has been further applied to enhance the SLR findings through
    ‘science mapping’ visualization techniques. This study presents the
    relevance, along with the movement, adoption and adaption of Industry 4.0 in
    the construction industry that further enables the spark of new ideas, in
    effort to realize and comprehend the current and future technological
    transformation in construction.

    In current practice, infrastructure organizations exchange data about their
    infrastructure systems (tangible capital assets) on a manual and ad hoc
    basis. The growing trend is to transform these manual data exchanges
    (transactions) to more structured, computer-to-computer based communications
    that are based on formalized transaction specifications. The core question
    in this research is “how to manage these transaction specifications?
    Existing standards focus on the development and not on the management of
    these transaction specifications in the domain of infrastructure management,
    which emphasizes the motivation to develop a web- based tool—Infrastructure
    Transaction Management Portal. An ontology-based approach was devised to
    develop the portal using the SharePoint platform. The portal was developed
    based on the knowledge represented in the Transaction Domain Ontology built
    as part of this research work. The transaction specification developed for
    the asset inventory and condition assessment reporting was used to
    demonstrate how a transaction specification can be managed using the
    proposed portal.

    Building permit automation has become a rising international topic in the
    past decade due to its convenience and efficiency. Automated compliance
    checking saves time and resources, which is beneficial for the construction
    industry. Researchers have already automated parts of the building permit
    process and the results proved that automated building requirement
    compliance checking is efficient. This thesis aims to contribute by
    developing an algorithm to automate the checking of building placement and
    parking availability. The algorithm should be able to: 1) check if the house
    is in a buildable area, 2) examine if the house placement meets the minimum
    distance requirement, 3) determine parking availability with accordance to
    house placement. 


    The algorithm in this study is developed in Feature Manipulation Engine
    (FME). Building placement automation is achieved through minimum distance
    logic while parking availability automation is achieved through
    transformations that utilize geometrical relationships. To test the
    algorithm, a case study is conducted for Höganäs municipality in Southern
    Sweden. 


    In Sweden, each municipality has its own detailed development plan, which
    regulates the usage of land and water within its geographical boundaries.
    The detailed development plan also regulates building requirements. The
    results of the testing indicate that the developed algorithm can accurately
    automate building placement and parking availability according to the
    requirements in Höganäs municipality’s detailed development plan. The
    results are satisfactory, demonstrating that it is feasible to automate the
    checking of certain building requirements in Sweden.

  abstract: >-
    One of the major goals of building information modeling is to support
    automated compliance checking (ACC). To support ACC, building design
    information needs to be extracted from building information models (BIMs)
    and transformed into a representation that would allow for automated
    reasoning about those design information in combination with information
    from regulatory documents. However, existing BIM information extraction (IE)
    efforts are limited in supporting complete automation of ACC. Complete
    automation of ACC requires (1) automating both the extraction of information
    from BIMs and the extraction of regulatory information from regulatory
    documents and (2) aligning the instances of information concepts and
    relations extracted from a BIM with those extracted from regulatory
    documents, in order to facilitate direct automated reasoning about both
    information for compliance assessment. To address this gap, this paper
    proposes an automated BIM IE method for extracting design information from
    industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs into a semantic logic-based
    representation that is aligned with a matching semantic logic-based
    representation of regulatory information. The proposed BIM IE method
    utilizes semantic natural language processing (NLP) techniques and java
    standard data access interface (JSDAI) techniques to automatically extract
    project information from IFC-based BIMs and transform it into a logic format
    (logic facts) that is ready to be automatically checked against
    logic-represented regulatory rules (logic rules). The BIM IE method was
    tested on extracting design information from a Duplex Apartment BIM model.
    Compared to a manually developed gold standard, the testing results showed
    100% precision and a short time of 15.02 seconds for processing 38,898 lines
    of data.

    To fully automate regulatory compliance checking of construction projects,
    regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted from various
    construction regulatory documents and then transformed into a formalized
    format that enables automated reasoning. To address this need, the authors
    propose an approach for automatically extracting information from
    construction regulatory textual documents and transforming them into logic
    clauses that could be directly used for automated reasoning. This paper
    focuses on presenting the proposed information transformation (ITr)
    methodology and the corresponding algorithms. The proposed ITr methodology
    utilizes a rule-based, semantic natural language processing (NLP) approach.
    A set of semantic mapping (SeM) rules and conflict resolution (CoR) rules
    are used to enable the automation of the transformation process. Several
    syntactic text features (captured using NLP techniques) and semantic text
    features (captured using an ontology) are used in the SeM and Co...

    The digital and integrated representation of the physical and functional
    characteristics of buildings enabled by building information modeling (BIM)
    provides a computational environment for automated compliance checking (ACC)
    of building designs. The integration of natural language processing (NLP)
    and artificial intelligence (AI) with BIM brings further opportunities for
    ACC – it can empower BIM with text analytics and AI capabilities, thereby
    injecting intelligence and automation in the compliance checking processes.
    This chapter highlights emerging approaches that aim to facilitate and
    harness the marriage of BIM, NLP, and AI to enable the next generation of
    automated compliance checking systems (ACC) systems. This chapter (1)
    reviews different types of BIM-based ACC systems that leverage NLP and AI
    techniques, (2) discusses how NLP and AI techniques are applied in
    regulatory text analytics tasks and BIM information analytics tasks in the
    context of ACC, and (3) discusses the future trends of BIM-based ACC
    systems.

    Sustainable building design has become a hot topic over the past decades.
    Many standards, databases, and tools have been developed for achieving a
    sustainable building. Not until recently have the importance of structural
    engineering and its contribution to sustainable building design been full
    recognised. However, due to the highly fragmented and diversity of knowledge
    across building and infrastructure domains, there is a lack of approach that
    can address all the sustainable issues within the structural design. +is
    paper reviews the sustainable design from the perspective of structural
    engineering: (1) reviewing the current situation; (2) identifying the gaps
    and difficulties; and (3) making recommendations for future improvements. +e
    strategies and indicators, as well as BIM-enabled methodology, for
    sustainable structural design (SSD) are also discussed in a holistic way. +e
    results of this investigation show that most of the methods are not doing
    well in terms of delivering a successful sustainable structural design. It
    is expected that the future BIM could probably provide such a platform to
    address these issues.

    Existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems are limited in their
    automation; they rely on the use of hard-coded, proprietary rules for
    representing regulatory requirements, which requires major manual effort in
    extracting regulatory information from textual regulatory documents and
    coding these information into a rule format. To address this limitation,
    this paper proposes a new unified ACC system that integrates: (1) semantic
    natural language processing techniques and EXPRESS data-based techniques to
    automatically extract and transform both regulatory information (in
    regulatory documents) and design information [in building information models
    (BIMs)] for automated compliance reasoning, and (2) semantic logic-based
    information representation so that the reasoning could be fully automated.
    To test the proposed system, a BIM test case was checked for compliance with
    Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009. Comparing to a
    manually-developed gold standard, 98.7% recall and 87.6% precision in
    noncompliance detection were achieved.

    In this paper we are reporting on a prototypical implementation of a model
    view checker for model instance validation of Industry Foundation Classes
    (IFC) models. This checker is developed based on the open standards mvdXML
    as the format for structuring validation rules and the BIM Collaboration
    Format (BCF) to issue reports as a result of the checking process. The
    checker is implemented on top of the open source bimserver.org framework.
    The research presented here has two main aims: (1) to develop an open source
    IFC validation tool based on flexible and standardized method; (2) to
    identify issues and capabilities of the current mvdXML rules based on
    real-world scenarios and to develop stable and easy-to-use IFC validation
    methods using open standards. Two BIM operational standards required by
    local building regulations and laws, the Dutch Rgd BIM Norm, and the
    Norwegian Statsbygg BIM Manual are used to validate both the mvdXML
    standardsÕ capabilities and the tools implementation. The rules from these
    standards are categorized into different rule types and converted to mvdXML
    templates and rules. These rules are then tested using a prototypical, open
    source software tool. By combining this tool with a BCF server we
    demonstrate the deployment of such automated checking procedures in real
    working processes. Based on these experiences, a detailed discussion about
    identified issues is provided as the starting point for the future research
    and a feedback to standardization organizations.

    Background

    Many research and development efforts have been made for automated
    compliance checking of building designs with regulatory requirements, but
    there is a lack of a non-proprietary and user-understandable representation
    of building regulations to support automated compliance checking in the
    construction domain that is experimentally tested for understandability and
    reading speed. Methods

    This research investigates a logic-based representation and tree-based
    visualization method for building regulatory requirements. The logic-based
    representation is based on classic logic programming language and can
    directly support automated compliance checking. The tree-based visualization
    is expected to improve the understandability and reading speed of the
    logic-based representation. Therefore, this method attempts to add to the
    limited research in non-proprietary and user-understandable representation
    of building regulations that is experimentally tested for understandability
    and reading speed. To test the understandability and reading speed of
    regulatory requirements using this representation and visualization method,
    a survey was conducted to compare different representations, namely, text,
    logic-based, and tree-based. ResultsStatistical analysis of the survey
    results shows that the proposed tree-based visualization method can
    significantly improve the understandability and reading speed of the
    logic-based regulatory requirement representation and this visualization
    method is at a comparable status with the original text representation of
    regulatory requirements in terms of understandability and reading speed.
    Conclusions(1) The investigated logic-based representation and tree-based
    visualization method for regulatory requirements serves as one potential
    non-proprietary and user-understandable representation of building
    regulations; (2) this research shows that computable representations of
    regulatory requirements can achieve understandability and reading speed that
    are comparable to the original text representation through tree-based
    visualization; and (3) this research reveals that the tree-based
    visualization of regulatory requirements improves the understandability and
    reading speed of regulatory requirements when such use is compared to the
    computable logic-based representation.

    In this paper we present a method for IFC instance validation based on
    semantic web technologies. This method is designed to facilitate reusing
    rules in order to simplify rule structuring processes. It aims to improve
    the modularity and reusability of validation constraints with an open and
    expressive method. A prototype model checking environment is implemented
    based on open source APIs and reasoning engines. Based on real BIM
    use-cases, requirement ontologies and related inference rules are defined to
    derive information from IFC instances to make them suitable for model
    checking. Checking constraints in these use-cases are classified according
    to their underlying logics to build a set of templates. All the ontologies,
    templates, inference rules and checking constraints are maintained as RDF
    graphs and can be published and distributed as web resources. Based on these
    experiences, a detailed discussion about added values, limitations and
    application strategies is also provided.

    Construction safety related knowledge and project specific information are
    scattered and fragmented. Despite technological advancements of information
    and knowledge management in the building and construction industry, a link
    between safety management and information models is still missing. The
    objective of this study is to investigate a new approach to organize, store
    and re-use construction safety knowledge. A construction safety ontology is
    proposed to formalize the safety management knowledge. It consists of three
    main domain ontology models, including Construction Product Model,
    Construction Process Model, and Construction Safety Model. One-on-one expert
    interviews were conducted for ontology evaluation. The interaction between
    safety ontology and Building Information Modeling (BIM) is also explored. A
    prototype application of ontology-based job hazard analysis (JHA) and
    visualization is implemented to further illustrate the applicability and
    effectiveness of the developed ontology. The developed construction safety
    ontology enables more effective inquiry of safety knowledge, which is the
    first step towards automated safety planning for JHA using BIM.

    A new ACC system that leverages semantic natural language processing (NLP)
    techniques to automatically extract information from regulatory documents
    and represent them in a logic based rule format is presented. A number of
    important efforts have been made, both in academia and industry, to automate
    the code compliance checking process. While important progress has been
    achieved, existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems are not
    entirely automated; manual effort is needed for extracting regulatory
    requirements from codes and encoding them in a computer processable rule
    format. To address this gap, this paper presents a new ACC system that
    leverages semantic natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
    automatically extract information from regulatory documents and represent
    them in a logic based rule format. The proposed systems is composed of three
    modules: (1) semantic NLP based regulatory information extraction and
    transformation algorithms to automatically extract regulatory information
    from regulatory documents into semantic tuples and automatically transform
    the extracted regulatory information in semantic tuples into logic rules;
    (2) semantic rule based design information extraction and transformation
    algorithms to automatically extract design information from building
    information models and transform the design information into logic facts;
    and (3) a logic-based reasoning algorithm to automatically reason about the
    logic rules and facts and generate compliance checking reports. To test the
    performance of the proposed system, as a whole, and how the different
    algorithms are performing together as one unit for detecting noncompliance
    instances, the proposed algorithms were implemented and integrated into a
    proof-of-concept prototype. The prototype was tested in checking the
    compliance of a design test case with Chapter 19 of the International
    Building Code 2009, and the performance was evaluated in terms of precision
    and recall.

    In this paper, we propose to extend SPARQL functions for querying building
    models. Building models captured by the IFC data model are the target data
    sources to develop extended functions. By extending these functions, we aim
    to 1) simplify writing queries and 2) retrieve useful information implied in
    building models. These functions are classified into four categories
    according to required data inputs. A prototype implementation is provided
    with indicate performance testing. Since this system is compatible with
    SPARQL and Linked Data environment, building models can be queried with data
    from other fields. A case study is conducted to query building and
    regulatory data for code compliance checking purpose. It demonstrates an
    approach which can be applied and extended for many other use cases. © 2016

    Automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction of
    requirements from regulatory textual documents and their formalization in a
    computer-processable rule representation. Such information extraction (IE)
    is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text.
    Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to process
    natural language text in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a
    semantic, rule-based NLP approach for automated IE from construction
    regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of
    pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict resolution (CR) rules in IE. A
    variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic
    (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the IE
    and CR rules. Phrase structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and
    separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and
    used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in
    the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The
    proposed IE algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements
    from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944
    precision and recall, respectively.

  abstract: >-
    As an essential prodecure to improve design quality in the construction
    industry, automated rule checking (ARC) requires intelligent rule
    interpretation from regulatory texts and precise alignment of concepts from
    different sources. However, there still exists semantic gaps between design
    models and regulatory texts, hindering the exploitation of ARC. Thus, a
    knowledge-informed framework for improved ARC is proposed based on natural
    language processing. Within the framework, an ontology is first established
    to represent domain knowledge, including concepts, synonyms, relationships,
    constraints, etc. Then, semantic alignment and conflict resolution are
    introduced to enhance the rule interpretation process based on predefined
    domain knowledge and unsupervised learning techniques. Finally, an algorithm
    is developed to identify the proper SPARQL function for each rule, and then
    to generate SPARQL-based queries for model checking purposes, thereby making
    it possible to interpret complex rules where extra implicit data needs to be
    inferred. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods
    successfully filled the semantic gaps between design models and regulatory
    texts with domain knowledge, which achieves a 90.1% accuracy and
    substantially outperforms the commonly used keyword matching method. In
    addition, the proposed rule interpretation method proves to be 5 times
    faster than the manual interpretation by domain experts. This research
    contributes to the body of knowledge of a novel framework and the
    corresponding methods to enhance automated rule checking with domain
    knowledge.

    Construction planning is a fundamental and challenging process in the
    management and execution of construction projects. The task of developing
    technical plans is critical to ensuring the success of a construction
    project. This task of preparing a technical plan is usually undertaken
    manually using two separate processes: (1) plan definition and (2)
    verification/checking. This paper introduces an ontological approach to
    support the plan definition and verification process. Using this approach,
    the technical plans are modeled into plan ontology in a layered modeling
    structure. The verification knowledge is modeled into ontology axioms and
    semantic rules. A case example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach
    for pit excavation. In addition, the proposed approach enables the
    compliance verification process to be undertaken in parallel with the
    technical plan definition. As a result, the plans' compliance can be ensured
    during the project delivery process. The research provides a novel
    ontological and semantic mechanism for reusing plans and their automatic
    verification in construction, which is semantically reasoned.

    Building environmental monitoring and compliance checking are important in
    ensuring environmental performance. The information required for monitoring
    and checking is obtained from different data sources in different
    information systems. In this context, information sharing between
    stakeholders and the semantic interoperability that prevails with varying
    information systems are necessary. However, the implementation of
    information sharing and semantic interoperability can be a challenge. This
    paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental
    monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling (BIM)
    environment among different information systems. The framework integrates
    building information from BIM, environmental information provided by
    sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design
    requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to
    represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and
    then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors,
    into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The
    regulation clauses are transformed into SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF
    Query Language) rules. A case study is performed to apply the framework, and
    environmental monitoring and automated compliance checking are implemented
    in the context of a real distributed energy station project. The testing
    results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
    framework.

    Regulations play an important role in assuring the construction quality.
    However, due to the large amount of regulation needs considered, the
    construction quality compliance checking against regulations can be
    cumbersome/time-consuming and error prone. In order to give more
    computerized support to the construction quality compliance checking against
    regulations, an ontology-based semantic modeling approach of regulation
    constraints is explored. A meta model for construction quality inspection
    and evaluation i.e. CQIEOntology is proposed in this paper. Based on
    CQIEontology, the regulation constraints are modeled into OWL axioms and
    SWRL rules. By these OWL axioms and SWRL rules, the regulation provisions
    imposed on construction quality inspection can be translated into a set of
    inspection tasks, and get associated with the specific construction tasks.
    Once the construction starts, the applicable inspection tasks, including a
    series of quality checking and evaluation, will be reminded and recommended.
    Obviously, the proposed approach facilitates taking the construction quality
    compliance checking as a paralleling activity to the construction rather
    than an afterthought, and helps the inspectors in quality inspection.
    Finally, the approach is demonstrated in Protégé 3.4.6 through case studies
    based on regulation examples taken from “Code for Acceptance of Construction
    Quality of Building Foundation (GB50202-2002) and the validation and
    discussion are given for it.”

  abstract: >-
    A semantic information alignment method is proposed to align the
    representations used in building information models (BIMs) to the
    representations used in energy regulations. Compared to existing alignment
    efforts, which are either manual or semi-automated, the proposed method aims
    to automate the alignment process for supporting fully automated energy
    compliance checking. A first-level simple alignment method is proposed to
    align single design information instances to single regulatory concepts, in
    which (1) domain knowledge is used for interpreting the meaning of concepts
    to recognize candidate instances, and (2) deep learning is used for
    capturing the semantics behind the words to measure semantic similarity and
    select the matches. A final complex alignment method is proposed to
    recognize the instance groups belonging to a regulatory requirement, in
    which (1) supervised and unsupervised searching algorithms are used to
    identify the instance pairs, and (2) network modeling is used to group and
    link the instance pairs to the requirement. The proposed method showed 93.4%
    recall and 94.7% precision on the testing data.
